> **IMPORTANT — Read before starting any work:**
> Always read `docs/STATUS.md` before beginning or continuing work on this project. It contains the latest project status, what is in progress, and recent decisions. Update it when completing significant work or making architectural decisions.
>
> **IMPORTANT — Deployment:**
> NEVER deploy to production unless the user explicitly asks you to deploy. The deploy workflow (`Deploy beanies PROD`) is manual-only (`workflow_dispatch`). Do not trigger it proactively — wait for an explicit instruction like "deploy to prod" or "push to prod".

>
> **IMPORTANT — UI Work:**
> Always consult `.claude/skills/beanies-theme.md` before any UI work (components, modals, styling, copy). It contains the complete design system, modal conventions, color rules, and component patterns. All modals must use the three-tier modal system (BaseModal → BeanieFormModal → ConfirmModal).

## Project Overview

beanies.family is the focal point of your family. It is a local-first, PWA-enabled family and financial planning and application. The main features include family financial planning, activity tracking, and family collaboration. The app allows families to track accounts, transactions, assets, and financial goals with multi-currency support and optional encrypted cloud sync to Google Drive. Additional features include keeping track of family activities, milestones, collaboration, and other things to help families learn, manage, and grow their beans together.

## Brand Identity

- **App name:** `beanies.family` — always lowercase with `.family`. Never "Beanies", "beanies", or "GP Family Planner".
- **Tagline:** _Every bean counts_ (sentence case, no period)
- **Primary font:** Outfit (headings, values) + Inter (body, data)
- **Primary color:** Heritage Orange `#F15D22` (energy, actions, CTAs, alerts — never use Alert Red)
- **Foundation color:** Deep Slate `#2C3E50` (anchor, trust, sidebar, headings, body text)
- **Accent colors:** Sky Silk `#AED6F1` (calm, safety, backgrounds), Terracotta `#E67E22` (warmth, milestones, gradient partner)
- **Background color:** Cloud White `#F8F9FA` (space, clarity, page backgrounds, cards)
- **Voice:** Simple, friendly, comforting, secure, familiar. Say "counting beans..." not "Loading..."
- **Golden rule:** The beanies hold hands and are never separated; never rotate the arrow.
- **Full guidelines:** `docs/brand/beanies-cig-v2.html`
- **Theme skill:** `.claude/skills/beanies-theme.md` — consult for all UI copy and component design
- **Typography standard:** Six-level scale from Display (`text-3xl`/`text-4xl`) to Caption (`text-xs`). Minimum 12px. Standard Tailwind classes only — no custom `text-[X.Xrem]`. See theme skill for full spec.

npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Type check

```

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Automerge-First Architecture**: Automerge CRDT document in memory is the source of truth. Encrypted `.beanpod` V4 file is the durable copy. IndexedDB is an ephemeral encrypted cache deleted on sign-out
2. **Multi-Currency**: Amounts stored with original currency, converted on-demand for display
3. **Family Profiles**: Each member has their own accounts/transactions, with shared family goals
4. **PWA Ready**: Service worker and manifest configured for offline support
5. **Privacy-Focused**: Data encrypted by default in a user-controlled file. No data stored on servers. IndexedDB cache deleted on sign-out
6. **Theme Support**: Light/dark mode with system preference detection

## Code Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `BaseButton.vue`)
- **Files**: camelCase for TypeScript, kebab-case for Vue pages
- **Stores**: Use Pinia composition API style
- **Types**: Centralized in `src/types/models.ts`
- **CSS**: Tailwind utility classes, custom CSS variables for theming
- **Typography**: Follow the six-level scale (Display/Page Title/Section Title/Item Title/Body/Caption). Use only standard Tailwind text classes (`text-xs` through `text-4xl`). Never use custom `text-[X.Xrem]` for font sizes. Minimum font size is `text-xs` (12px). See `.claude/skills/beanies-theme.md` for the full standard.
- **Text casing**: Dual standard in `uiStrings.ts` — `en` values use Title Case for labels/headers and Sentence case for full sentences (standard English). `beanie` values are all lowercase (the cosmetic overlay for beanie mode). Every entry must have both `en` and `beanie`. CSS `uppercase` handles visual uppercasing for section headers and form labels. See `.claude/skills/beanies-theme.md` § Text Casing Standard.
- **UI Text / i18n**: All user-visible text **must** go through the translation system — never hardcode English strings in templates. Define strings in `src/services/translation/uiStrings.ts` and use `{{ t('key') }}` in templates via `useTranslation()`. This enables Chinese translation, beanie mode overrides, and future languages. See ADR-008 for details.
- **Translation script sync**: When modifying the structure of `uiStrings.ts` (renaming objects, changing export patterns, etc.), also verify and update the parser in `scripts/updateTranslations.mjs`. Run `npm run translate` to confirm parsing still works. The script parses TypeScript at the text level and will silently break if the format changes. See `docs/TRANSLATION.md` for full pipeline docs.
- **Plans**: When plan mode is used, save the accepted plan to `docs/plans/` before implementation begins (see Plans Archive below).
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: This is a **core principle** — enforce it rigorously across all code:
  - **Shared components**: When the same UI pattern (modal, form, card) appears in 2+ locations, extract it into a shared component. Use prop-driven visibility and self-contained internal state. See `TodoViewEditModal.vue` and `ActivityModal.vue` as reference patterns.
  - **Helper functions**: Extract repeated logic into composables (`src/composables/`) or utility functions (`src/utils/`). Never copy-paste logic between files.
  - **Reduce duplication**: Actively look for and consolidate duplicate code during every change. If you see the same pattern in multiple places, refactor it.
  - **Simplify flows**: Remove overly complicated or redundant code paths. Prefer a single clear implementation over multiple partial ones.
  - **Constants and config**: Shared values (colors, options, validation rules) belong in constants files, not scattered across components.
  - **When unsure**: If it's unclear whether to extract or inline, ask the user before proceeding.

## Issue Implementation Workflow

When asked to implement a GitHub issue/ticket:

1. **Assign** the issue to the person who requested the work
2. **Move to in progress**: Apply the `in-progress` label and add a comment noting implementation is starting, with a brief summary of the approach
3. **Implement** the feature/fix
4. **Mark ready for testing**: Once complete, remove the `in-progress` label, apply the `ready-for-testing` label, and add a comment summarizing the changes made
5. **Ask questions** before starting if requirements are unclear

## Issue Labeling

Every issue must have relevant labels applied. When creating or triaging issues, always add:

1. **Type** (required — pick one): `enhancement`, `bug`, `refactor`, `performance`, `accessibility`, `documentation`, `testing`
2. **Priority** (required — pick one): `priority: critical`, `priority: high`, `priority: medium`, `priority: low`
3. **Page** (if applicable — pick all that apply): `page: dashboard`, `page: accounts`, `page: transactions`, `page: assets`, `page: goals`, `page: reports`, `page: forecast`, `page: family`, `page: settings`, `page: login`
4. **Area** (if applicable — pick all that apply): `area: ui`, `area: data`, `area: sync`, `area: brand`, `area: i18n`, `area: pwa`
5. **Special** (as needed): `security`, `auth`, `privacy`
6. **Status** (managed during implementation): Apply `in-progress` when work begins, replace with `ready-for-testing` when implementation is complete and ready for review

## Plans Archive

Implementation plans created during plan mode must be saved to `docs/plans/` **before** implementation begins. This provides a version-controlled record of what was planned and why, enabling future reference when improving or extending features.

**Workflow:**

1. Plan mode produces a plan document
2. Once the user approves the plan, save it to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<short-slug>.md` (e.g., `docs/plans/2026-02-22-currency-chips-and-language-picker.md`)
3. Begin implementation
4. The plan file stays in the repo permanently — it is a historical record

**Plan file format:**

```markdown
# Plan: <Title>

> Date: YYYY-MM-DD
> Related issues: #<number>, #<number>

## Context

<Why this work is needed>

## Approach

<The accepted implementation plan>

## Files affected

<List of files to be created or modified>
```

## Notes for AI Assistants

- This is a Phase 1 MVP - prioritize core functionality
- All data operations go through Pinia stores -> Automerge repositories
- Use existing UI components from `src/components/ui/`
- **UI theme**: Always read `.claude/skills/beanies-theme.md` before any UI work. Use the three-tier modal system (BaseModal/BeanieFormModal/ConfirmModal). Use brand colors, squircle corners, and Outfit/Inter typography. Never use Alert Red — Heritage Orange is the alert color. Follow the typography standard (six levels: Display/Page Title/Section Title/Item Title/Body/Caption). Never use custom `text-[X.Xrem]` sizes — only standard Tailwind classes (`text-xs` through `text-4xl`). Minimum font size is `text-xs` (12px).
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Maintain TypeScript type safety
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Test changes with `npm run dev`
- **DRY is mandatory**: Before writing new code, check for existing components, composables, and utilities that already solve the problem. Consolidate duplicates on sight. If unsure whether to extract shared logic, ask.
- **i18n**: Never hardcode user-visible English text in Vue templates. Always add strings to `src/services/translation/uiStrings.ts` and use `t('key')` via `useTranslation()`.
- **Plans**: When exiting plan mode, save the accepted plan to `docs/plans/` before writing any code.
- **Prettier**: `docs/brand/` HTML files are excluded from Prettier formatting (see `.prettierignore`). Do not reformat them.
