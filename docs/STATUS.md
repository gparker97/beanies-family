## Current Phase

**Phase 1 — MVP** (In Progress)

## Completed Work

### Infrastructure

- Project scaffold with Vite + Vue 3 + TypeScript
- IndexedDB service with repositories (native IndexedDB APIs)

- Accounts management (full CRUD, card-based layout)
- Transactions management (full CRUD, with date filter, category icons)
- Assets management (full CRUD, loan tracking, combined net worth)
- Goals management (full CRUD, collapsible completed goals section)
- Reports page (net worth, income vs expenses, extended date ranges, category breakdowns)
- Family member management (global member filter)
- Settings page (currency, theme, sync, encryption)
- First-run setup wizard
- Multi-currency display with global display currency selector
- Family Nook home screen (`/nook`) — greeting, status toast, family beans row, schedule cards, inline todo widget with view/edit modals, milestones, piggy bank card, recent activity feed. Overdue task detection with orange pill + ⏰ indicator. Task description preview (2-line clamp) on cards. `/` redirects to `/nook`

### Beanie Brand Asset Icons

- `beanies_covering_eyes_transparent_512x512.png` — replaces all lock/closed-padlock SVG icons (privacy mode active, data encrypted, data hidden)
- `beanies_open_eyes_transparent_512x512.png` — replaces all open-padlock SVG icons (privacy mode off, data visible, data unencrypted)
- `beanies_impact_bullet_transparent_192x192.png` — replaces warning/alert/exclamation SVG icons and all feature bullet point icons (SyncStatusIndicator warning, PasskeySettings alert, LoginPage security bullets, SetupPage security bullets)
- Theme skill (`.claude/skills/beanies-theme.md`) updated with icon usage guide

### Centralized Icon System (Issue #44)

- **`src/constants/icons.ts`** — Central registry of ~72 beanie-styled SVG icon definitions with `BeanieIconDef` type. Organized into: NAV (9), ACTION (8), SUMMARY (5), UTILITY (10), STATUS (4), CATEGORY (28), ACCOUNT_TYPE (8), ASSET_TYPE (9). Helper functions: `getIconDef()`, `getAccountTypeIcon()`, `getAssetTypeIcon()`
- **`src/components/ui/BeanieIcon.vue`** — Universal icon component enforcing brand style (stroke-width 1.75, round linecap/linejoin). Props: `name`, `size` (xs/sm/md/lg/xl), `strokeWidth`. Falls back to three-dot circle for unknown icons
- **`src/components/common/PageHeader.vue`** — Shared page header with 40px rounded-xl icon container + title + subtitle + action slot
- **15 files migrated** — All inline SVGs replaced with BeanieIcon in: AppSidebar, AppHeader, BaseModal, CategoryIcon, AccountTypeIcon, DashboardPage, AccountsPage, TransactionsPage, AssetsPage, GoalsPage, ReportsPage, ForecastPage, FamilyPage, SettingsPage
- CategoryIcon.vue reduced from ~365 lines to ~45 lines (19-branch v-if chain → single BeanieIcon)
- AccountsPage reduced from 893 to ~591 lines; AssetsPage collapsed 2x 9-branch asset type icon chains
- Zero inline `<svg>` elements remaining in all migrated files

### Micro-Animations (Issue #45)

- Page header icon bounce on load, sidebar hover wobble/scale, card hover lift
- Summary card count-up animation, goal progress bar fill animation
- Empty state floating/breathing animation
- Privacy toggle beanie blink, theme toggle rotation
- All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- CSS `@keyframes` using hardware-accelerated `transform` + `opacity`

### Empty State Beanie Illustrations (Issue #47)

- Beanie character illustrations for all empty states: accounts, transactions, recurring, assets, goals, reports, dashboard
- `EmptyStateIllustration.vue` component with variant prop
- Stored in `public/brand/empty-states/`

### 404 Page Redesign (Issue #48)

- Full beanie-themed 404 page with lost beanie illustration
- Playful heading and encouraging subtext, brand-styled CTA

### Loading States with Brand Spinner (Issue #49)

- `BeanieSpinner.vue` component using `beanies_spinner_transparent_192x192.png`
- Brand spinner for all loading states (app load, language switching, data fetch, button loading)
- Loading text: "counting beans..." (never "Loading...")

### Forecast "Coming Soon" Redesign (Issue #50)

- Beanie with telescope illustration
- Warm brand-voice copy, beanie impact bullet icons for feature list

### Sound Effects System (Issue #46)

- **`src/composables/useSounds.ts`** — Web Audio API synthesised sounds (zero bundle size, sub-ms latency)
- 6 sound functions: `playPop()`, `playClink()`, `playChime()`, `playFanfare()`, `playWhoosh()`, `playBlink()`
- `soundEnabled` global setting (defaults to `true`) with toggle in Settings > General
- AudioContext created lazily on first user gesture (browser autoplay compliance)
- Celebration integration: `playChime()` on toast celebrations, `playFanfare()` on modal celebrations
- Delete actions: `playWhoosh()` on account/transaction/recurring/asset/goal deletes
- Privacy toggle: `playBlink()` on header privacy eye toggle
- App.vue watcher syncs `soundEnabled` setting to composable
- Goal completion detection fixed: `updateGoal()` now detects completion transitions and fires celebrations (previously only `updateProgress()` did, which was never called from UI)
- Goals empty state fixed: shows when all goals are completed (was checking all goals instead of active goals)
- Celebration toast image enlarged from 40px to 80px
- Unit tests (5) and E2E tests (3)

### Multi-Family Architecture (Stage 1)

- Per-family database architecture: each family gets its own IndexedDB (`gp-family-finance-{familyId}`)
- Registry database (`gp-finance-registry`): stores families, user mappings, global settings
- Family context orchestrator (`familyContext.ts`) and Pinia store (`familyContextStore.ts`)
- Legacy migration service: auto-migrates single-DB data to per-family DB on first boot
- Global settings split from per-family settings (theme, language, exchange rates are device-level)
- Sync file format v2.0: includes `familyId` and `familyName` (backward-compatible with v1.0)
- Per-family file handle storage for sync
- New types: `Family`, `UserFamilyMapping`, `GlobalSettings`
- All existing repositories work unchanged (transparent multi-tenancy via `getDatabase()`)
- E2E test helpers updated for dynamic per-family DB discovery

### File-Based Authentication (replacing Cognito)

- **Password service** (`src/services/auth/passwordService.ts`): PBKDF2 hashing (100k iterations, SHA-256, 16-byte salt, 32-byte hash) with constant-time verification
- **Auth store** (`src/stores/authStore.ts`): complete rewrite — signIn (member picker + password), signUp (owner creates pod), setPassword (joiner onboarding), signOut
- **Login flow**: WelcomeGate → LoadPodView (file picker + decrypt modal) → PickBeanView (member picker + password) / CreatePodView (3-step wizard) / JoinPodView (family code entry)
- **Data model**: `passwordHash` and `requiresPassword` fields on `FamilyMember`
- Route guards: all app routes have `requiresAuth: true`, login route exempt
- App.vue bootstrap simplified: global settings → auth init → family resolution → data load
- ADR-014 (file-based auth decision), supersedes ADR-010 and ADR-013

### Passkey / Biometric Authentication (Issue #16)

- `passkeyCrypto.ts`: PRF helpers, HKDF key derivation, AES-KW DEK wrapping/unwrapping
- `passkeyService.ts`: Full WebAuthn registration + assertion with PRF and non-PRF paths
- `passkeyRepository.ts`: IndexedDB CRUD for passkey registrations (registry DB v3)
- Dual-path strategy: PRF (true passwordless) + cached password fallback (Firefox)
- `BiometricLoginView.vue`: One-tap biometric login on returning devices
- `PasskeyPromptModal.vue`: Post-sign-in prompt to enable biometric login
- `PasskeySettings.vue`: Full management UI (register, list, remove passkeys)
- Password change invalidates PRF-wrapped DEKs, updates cached passwords
- ADR-015 documents the architectural decision
- `PasskeySettings.vue` component: lists registered passkeys, register new, remove existing
- Requires server-side challenge generation for full flow (deferred)

### Cognito Removal

- Deleted: `src/config/cognito.ts`, `src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`, `src/services/auth/tokenManager.ts`, `src/services/auth/index.ts`, `src/services/api/adminApi.ts`
- Deleted: `src/pages/MagicLinkCallbackPage.vue`, `src/components/login/VerificationCodeForm.vue`, `src/components/family/CreateMemberAccountModal.vue`
- Deleted: `infrastructure/modules/auth/` (Cognito User Pool), `infrastructure/modules/api/` (Lambda + API Gateway), `infrastructure/scripts/cognito-sync-check.sh`
- Removed `amazon-cognito-identity-js` package (~165KB bundle reduction)
- Removed `cachedSessions` object store from registry database (v1 → v2 migration)
- Removed `CachedAuthSession` type, `isLocalOnly` from `UserFamilyMapping`, `isLocalOnlyMode` from `GlobalSettings`
- Removed Cognito env vars from `.env.example`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, `vite.config.ts`

### File-First Architecture

- Encrypted data file is the source of truth; IndexedDB is a temporary cache deleted on sign-out
- Sign-out cleanup: `deleteFamilyDatabase()`, `resetState()` on all data stores, file handle preserved
- App startup always loads from data file when configured; IndexedDB fallback only when file permission not yet granted
- Auto-sync always on when file is configured (no toggle)
- Setup wizard adds Step 3 "Secure Your Data": requires file creation with encryption password
- Default `encryptionEnabled` changed to `true`
- Settings renamed "File Sync" → "Family Data Options"; removed Sync Now, Disconnect, Auto-sync toggle
- Encryption toggle warns before disabling
- SyncStatusIndicator: "Syncing..." → "Saving...", "Synced to..." → "Data saved to..."
- Login page: three security benefit bullet points (encrypted file, no server storage, cloud backup via folder)
- ADR-011: file-first architecture decision record

- Updated AppHeader: primary colours for active states and privacy toggle
- Updated all 12 page files: brand colours, brand name, brand backgrounds
- Added `CelebrationOverlay.vue` component with toast (4s auto-dismiss) and modal modes
- Added `useCelebration` composable with six celebration triggers wired to key app events:
  - Setup complete, first file save, first account, first transaction, goal reached, debt paid off
- Added pod spinner loading overlay in `App.vue` ("counting beans..." copy)
- Added project-local skill `.claude/skills/beanies-theme.md`

### Beanie Character Avatars (Issue #39) — Closed

- **`src/constants/avatars.ts`** — 8 SVG avatar variant definitions (`adult-male`, `adult-female`, `adult-other`, `child-male`, `child-female`, `child-other`, `family-group`, `family-filtered`). Bean/pill body shapes with dot eyes, arc smiles. All children wear beanie hats (brand signature). Adults have optional cap (male), bow + shoulder-length hair (female), or clean body (other). Female variants have full hair dome + flowing side strands + clear bowtie (two triangles meeting at a point)
- **`src/components/ui/BeanieAvatar.vue`** — Avatar rendering component with `variant`, `color`, `size` (xs/sm/md/lg/xl), `ariaLabel` props. Renders inline SVG filled with member's profile color, features in Deep Slate. `family-group` renders 4 distinct characters (2 adults + 2 children with beanies) in brand colors (Heritage Orange, Sky Silk, Terracotta, Soft Teal). `family-filtered` renders bean + funnel overlay
- **`src/composables/useMemberAvatar.ts`** — `getAvatarVariant(gender, ageGroup)`, `getMemberAvatarVariant(member)` (with defaults for legacy records), reactive `useMemberAvatar(memberRef)` and `useFilterAvatar(allSelectedRef)` composables
- **Data model** — Added `Gender` (`male`|`female`|`other`), `AgeGroup` (`adult`|`child`), and optional `DateOfBirth` (`{ month, day, year? }`) to `FamilyMember` interface
- **Repository migration** — `applyDefaults()` in `familyMemberRepository.ts` ensures legacy records get `gender: 'other'`, `ageGroup: 'adult'`
- **FamilyPage** — Gender + age group selects (Male/Female/Other, default Male), date of birth dropdowns (month Jan-Dec, day 1-31, optional year), live avatar preview in add/edit member modals. Member cards show BeanieAvatar instead of initial circles. Full edit member modal with pencil icon on each card
- **Header filter icons** — MemberFilterDropdown trigger shows: family-group BeanieAvatar (lg) + "all" when all selected, individual member avatar + name when one selected, filtered icon + count for partial selection. Borderless trigger style (no border/background, tight spacing with arrow)
- **BaseMultiSelect** — Added `#trigger` and `#option` scoped slots + `borderless` prop (backward compatible)
- **BaseSelect** — Fixed right padding (`pl-3 pr-8`) so dropdown arrow is always visible
- **AppHeader** — Profile avatar replaced with BeanieAvatar (falls back to `adult-other`)
- **SetupPage + AuthStore** — Default `gender: 'male'`, `ageGroup: 'adult'` for owner creation
- 15 new translation keys with beanie mode overrides
- Unit tests: 14 tests (composable + avatar definitions)
- E2E tests: 4 specs (header avatar, family cards, add child member, filter dropdown)

### Sidebar Redesign (Issue #59)

- **`src/constants/navigation.ts`** — Shared `NavItemDef` interface and `NAV_ITEMS` array with `PRIMARY_NAV_ITEMS`/`SECONDARY_NAV_ITEMS` exports. Emoji icons, primary/secondary section split. Ready for reuse by mobile bottom nav
- **`src/components/common/AppSidebar.vue`** — Full v3 redesign:
  - Permanent Deep Slate (`#2C3E50`) background — always dark, no light/dark toggle needed
  - Brand logo in 42px squircle with `bg-white/[0.08]` tint
  - Wordmark: "beanies" white + ".family" Heritage Orange, italic tagline at 0.5rem/25% opacity
  - Emoji nav icons replacing BeanieIcon SVGs for warmth (per CIG v2)
  - Active nav item: Heritage Orange gradient (`from-[rgba(241,93,34,0.2)]`) + 4px left border
  - Hover: subtle `bg-white/[0.05]` with text brightening from 40% to 70%
  - Primary/secondary nav separated by `h-px bg-white/[0.08]` divider
  - User profile card at bottom: BeanieAvatar + owner name/role in `bg-white/[0.04]` rounded card
  - Security indicators at 30% opacity ("felt not seen"): file icon + name, lock/unlock, version
  - Removed: `SyncStatusIndicator` component, `BeanieIcon` import, `hoveredPath` ref, hover event listeners, all dark mode conditional classes

### Header Redesign (Issue #67) — Closed

- Removed bottom border, background color, and theme toggle from header
- Page title moved into header left side (Dashboard shows greeting, other pages show `route.meta.title`)
- Removed `PageHeader` component from 7 pages (Accounts, Transactions, Assets, Goals, Reports, Forecast, Settings)
- All controls restyled as squircle containers (`h-10 w-10 rounded-[14px]`) with subtle hover backgrounds
- Currency selector: symbol only (e.g. `$`), language selector: flag only
- Privacy toggle: green status dot (`bg-[#27AE60]`) when figures visible
- Notification bell: BeanieIcon with Heritage Orange dot (static for now)
- Profile: avatar + chevron only, name/email shown in dropdown panel
- `bell` icon added to `UTILITY_ICONS` in `icons.ts`

### Configurable Currency Chips (Issue #36) — Closed

- `preferredCurrencies` added to Settings model and IndexedDB repository
- Settings page: multi-select for up to 4 preferred currencies with removable chips
- Header: inline currency chips in white-bg pill — active chip in Heritage Orange, click to switch instantly
- All currency dropdowns show preferred currencies first via shared `useCurrencyOptions()` composable
- Fallback to baseCurrency if active display currency is removed from preferred list

### Branded Language Picker Flags (Issue #38) — Closed

- SVG flag images (`/brand/flags/us.svg`, `/brand/flags/cn.svg`) for cross-platform rendering (emoji flags don't render on Windows)
- Language picker uses `<img>` tags with SVG flags in white-bg pill + chevron
- Dropdown rows show flag in squircle container + native name with Heritage Orange active highlight
- `flagIcon` field added to `LanguageInfo` interface

### Design System Foundation (Issue #57) — Closed

- All dashboard components created: NetWorthHeroCard, SummaryStatCard, GoalProgressItem, ActivityItem, FamilyBeanRow, RecurringSummaryWidget
- UI components: ToggleSwitch, ToastNotification, BeanieAvatar
- CSS custom properties (--card-shadow, --sq, --silk10, etc.) added to style.css

- All cards use v3 rounded-3xl styling with hover lift

### i18n Full String Extraction

- Audited all 15+ Vue files, extracted ~200 hardcoded English strings to `uiStrings.ts`
- All UI text now uses `t('key')` translation calls — enables Chinese translation and beanie mode for all strings
- Files updated: DashboardPage, AppHeader, AppSidebar, SettingsPage, TransactionsPage, ReportsPage, FamilyPage, SetupPage, LoginPage, MagicLinkCallbackPage, PasswordModal, FamilyBeanRow, RecurringSummaryWidget, NetWorthHeroCard
- Project documentation updated: all new UI text must use the translation system, never hardcoded

### Net Worth Chart Axis Labels

- Y-axis compact labels with currency symbol (e.g. `$125k`, `$1.2M`)
- X-axis date labels with Outfit font, last label shows "Today"
- Horizontal grid lines at 4% white opacity
- Chart height increased from h-20 to h-28

### Plans Archive

- `docs/plans/` directory created with naming convention and workflow documentation
- Accepted implementation plans saved before work begins for historical reference
- Rule added to CLAUDE.md project documentation

### Performance Reference Document

- `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` created covering client-side resource boundaries, growth projections, and 8 prioritized mitigation strategies
- Published to GitHub wiki

### Family Member Role Display Fix

- `FamilyBeanRow.vue` `getRoleLabel` now checks `member.ageGroup` (adult/child) instead of only `member.role`
- Adults with 'member' role correctly show "Parent"/"Big Bean" instead of "Little Bean"

### Functional Net Worth Chart (Issue #66) — Closed

- **`src/composables/useNetWorthHistory.ts`** — Computes historical net worth by replaying transactions backwards from current account balances. Supports 5 time periods (1W daily, 1M daily, 3M every 3 days, 1Y biweekly, All auto-scaled ~30 points). Returns period-over-period change amount and percentage. Computes last-month vs this-month deltas for income, expenses, and cash flow. Respects global member filter
- **`NetWorthHeroCard.vue`** — Static SVG sparkline replaced with Chart.js `<Line>` area chart via vue-chartjs. Heritage Orange line (`#F15D22`) with gradient fill (30% → transparent). Subtle grid lines at 4% white opacity. Glowing dot marks current value. Period pills now functional — clicking changes chart range and recomputes comparison. Dynamic period label ("this week"/"this month"/"past 3 months"/"this year"/"all time"). Privacy mode shows "Chart hidden" placeholder. Empty state shows "No data yet". Custom tooltip with brand styling
- **`DashboardPage.vue`** — Wired up composable: `changeAmount`/`changePercent`/`selectedPeriod`/`historyData` to hero card, `incomeChange`/`expenseChange`/`cashFlowChange` to summary stat cards for "vs last month" comparison
- Assets treated as constant in history (no historical valuation data in MVP)

### PNG Brand Character Avatars (Issue #65) — Closed

- Replaced inline SVG avatar rendering with hand-crafted PNG brand assets from `public/brand/`
- **`BeanieAvatar.vue`** — Rewritten from `<svg>` to `<div>` + `<img>`. Each avatar shows colored ring border (2px solid in member's color) + soft pastel background (member color at ~12% opacity). `family-filtered` variant shows small funnel badge overlay (SVG icon in dark circle)
- **`avatars.ts`** — Removed `BeanieAvatarDef` interface, `BEANIE_AVATARS` SVG paths, `getAvatarDef()`. Replaced with `AVATAR_IMAGE_PATHS` mapping variants to PNG paths, `getAvatarImagePath()`. `AvatarVariant` type preserved
- PNG asset mapping: `adult-male` → father, `adult-female` → mother, `child-male` → baby boy, `child-female` → baby girl, `adult-other`/`child-other` → neutral, `family-group` → family, `family-filtered` → neutral + funnel badge
- Unit tests rewritten (8 tests — PNG path assertions replace SVG path assertions)
- E2E tests updated to check for `<img>` elements with `/brand/beanies_*.png` sources

### Branded Confirmation Modal (Issue #56) — Closed

- `useConfirm` composable (singleton pattern matching `useCelebration`): `confirm()` and `alert()` return `Promise<boolean>`
- `ConfirmModal.vue` component wrapping `BaseModal` + `BaseButton` + `BeanieIcon` with danger (red) and info (orange) variants
- All 9 native `confirm()`/`alert()` calls replaced across 6 files (Accounts, Transactions, Assets, Goals, Family, PasskeySettings)
- 14 new i18n keys for dialog titles and messages with beanie mode overrides
- Wired into `App.vue` alongside `CelebrationOverlay`

### Dashboard Count-Up Animation Restore

- Re-integrated `useCountUp` composable into `SummaryStatCard` for animated number transitions
- Animation triggers on page load, view switching (component remount), and privacy mode reveal (target returns 0 when masked)
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility setting

### Blurred Masked Chart

- Dashboard net worth chart shows blurred view (`blur-md`) instead of "chart hidden" placeholder when privacy masking is on
- Matches Reports page pattern; `pointer-events-none` prevents tooltip data leaks
- Smooth CSS transition (`transition-all duration-300`) between blurred and clear states

### Mobile Responsive Layout (Issue #63)

- **`src/composables/useBreakpoint.ts`** — Reactive `isMobile` / `isTablet` / `isDesktop` refs using `matchMedia` with singleton listeners, SSR-safe defaults
- **`src/components/common/MobileBottomNav.vue`** — Fixed bottom tab bar (5 tabs: Nook, Planner, Piggy Bank, Budget, Pod) with safe area insets, Heritage Orange 8% background pill active state, nested route matching, dark mode support
- **`src/components/common/MobileHamburgerMenu.vue`** — Full-screen slide-in overlay from left with Deep Slate background, brand logo, controls section (member filter, privacy toggle, language selector, currency chips), all 9 nav items, user profile card, security indicators footer. Closes on backdrop click, Escape key, and route change
- **`src/components/common/AppHeader.vue`** — Mobile: hamburger button + greeting/page title + notification bell. Desktop: unchanged (all controls preserved)
- **`src/App.vue`** — Sidebar hidden on mobile (`v-if="isDesktop"`), bottom nav shown on mobile, hamburger menu wired up, reduced mobile padding (`p-4 md:p-6`), bottom padding clearance (`pb-24`)
- **`src/components/ui/BaseModal.vue`** — `fullscreenMobile` prop: removes rounded corners and max-width on mobile viewports
- **`src/constants/navigation.ts`** — `MobileTabDef` interface and `MOBILE_TAB_ITEMS` constant (5 tabs: Nook, Planner, Piggy Bank, Budget, Pod)
- **`src/services/translation/uiStrings.ts`** — 7 new i18n keys: `mobile.nook`, `mobile.pod`, `mobile.menu`, `mobile.closeMenu`, `mobile.navigation`, `mobile.controls`, `mobile.viewingAll`
- **Responsive page pass** — Fixed hardcoded grid/width classes across 5 pages:
  - TransactionsPage: `grid-cols-2` → `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` (2 form modals)
  - GoalsPage: `grid-cols-2` → `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` (2 form modals)
  - AssetsPage: `grid-cols-2` → `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` (card value display)
  - ReportsPage: `w-64`/`w-48`/`w-40` → `w-full md:w-*` (4 fixed-width selects)
  - FamilyPage: `grid-cols-2`/`grid-cols-3` → responsive variants (4 form grids)

### PWA Functionality (Issue #6) — Closed

- **`index.html`** — Added PWA meta tags: `theme-color` (with dark mode media variant), `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style`, `apple-mobile-web-app-title`, `description`
- **`vite.config.ts`** — Completed manifest (`start_url`, `scope`, `orientation`, `categories`); changed `registerType` from `autoUpdate` to `prompt` for user-controlled SW updates
- **`src/composables/useOnline.ts`** — Singleton reactive `isOnline` ref with `online`/`offline` event listeners
- **`src/composables/usePWA.ts`** — `canInstall`, `isInstalled`, `installApp()`, `dismissInstallPrompt()` with 7-day localStorage dismissal persistence; `beforeinstallprompt` handling, standalone mode detection
- **`src/components/common/OfflineBanner.vue`** — Heritage Orange slide-down banner when offline ("You're offline — changes are saved locally"), `aria-live="polite"`
- **`src/components/common/InstallPrompt.vue`** — Dismissible install card shown 30s after page load with brand icon, install/dismiss buttons, bottom-positioned on mobile, bottom-right on desktop
- **`src/components/common/UpdatePrompt.vue`** — Deep Slate banner using `useRegisterSW` from `virtual:pwa-register/vue` with "Update now" / "Later" buttons, hourly background update checks
- **Settings page** — "Install App" card section visible when installable or already installed (green checkmark)
- **`MobileHamburgerMenu.vue`** — Added loading spinner to mobile language selector (was missing visual feedback during translation)
- 12 new i18n keys with beanie mode overrides (`pwa.*`, `settings.installApp*`)
- 4 new test files (19 tests): useOnline, usePWA, OfflineBanner, MobileBottomNav
- **E2E fix** — TrustDeviceModal dismissed in auth helper to prevent pointer event interception in CI

### Automated Translation Pipeline

- Fixed broken `scripts/updateTranslations.mjs` parser (was matching `UI_STRINGS`, now parses `STRING_DEFS` line-by-line)
- Added `--all` flag for multi-language translation (default behavior), stale key cleanup, CI-friendly summary output
- Populated `public/translations/zh.json` with all 655 translations (was 287)
- Created `.github/workflows/translation-sync.yml` — daily cron at 3 AM UTC with conditional auto-deploy
- Updated `package.json` translate scripts, `scripts/README.md`, ADR-008, new `docs/TRANSLATION.md`
- Added Playwright browser caching to CI workflow (saves ~8 min per E2E run)

### Mobile Privacy Toggle

- Show/hide financial figures icon now always visible in mobile/tablet header (previously buried in hamburger menu)
- Sits next to notification bell with same squircle styling, beanie blink animation, and green status dot

### Count-Up Animation for All Summary Cards

- **`src/composables/useAnimatedCurrency.ts`** — Reusable composable wrapping `useCountUp` + `convertToDisplay` + `formatCurrencyWithCode` + privacy mode masking. Returns `{ formatted, displayValue }`. When privacy mode is on, target drops to 0 so revealing figures triggers a fresh count-up from zero
- **NetWorthHeroCard** — Hero net worth amount (800ms duration) and change amount (200ms delay) now animate on load and when values change
- **AccountsPage** — 3 summary cards (Total Assets, Total Liabilities, Net Worth) with staggered delays (0/100/200ms)
- **TransactionsPage** — 6 summary cards: 3 transaction tab (Period Income, Expenses, Net) + 3 recurring tab (Monthly Income, Expenses, Net) with staggered delays
- **AssetsPage** — 4 summary cards (Total Asset Value, Total Loans, Net Asset Value, Appreciation/Depreciation) with staggered delays (0/100/200/300ms)
- **GoalsPage** — 3 integer count cards (Active, Completed, Overdue goals) using `useCountUp` directly with staggered delays
- All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility setting

### Trusted Device Mode (Issue #74) — Closed

- `isTrustedDevice` and `trustedDevicePromptShown` flags in GlobalSettings (registry DB)
- `signOut()` conditionally preserves IndexedDB cache when trusted device is enabled
- `signOutAndClearData()` action always deletes cache regardless of trust setting
- One-time `TrustDeviceModal` shown after first successful sign-in + data load
- Settings toggle in Security section to enable/disable trusted device
- Hamburger menu shows dual sign-out options when trusted device is on
- 8 new i18n keys for trust prompt, settings toggle, and sign-out options

### Login Page UI Redesign (Issue #69) — Closed

- **5-view login flow** per v6 wireframes replacing the old 4-view monolithic flow:
  - **Welcome Gate (00a)** — Three large branded path cards: "Sign in to your pod", "Create a new pod!" (Heritage Orange gradient), "Join an existing pod"
  - **Load Pod (00b)** — File picker drop zone, disabled cloud connector placeholders (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud), security messaging cards, integrated decrypt modal (BaseModal with password input, auto-decrypt via sessionStorage cached password)
  - **Pick Bean (00b-3)** — Avatar grid with `BeanieAvatar` at 88px, green/orange status indicators, password form for sign-in or create-password for new members, back button returns to avatar grid when member selected
  - **Create Pod (00c)** — 3-step mini-onboarding wizard: Step 1 name/password → Step 2 choose storage (local file via `showSaveFilePicker`) → Step 3 add family members. Navigates directly to `/dashboard`
  - **Join Pod (00d)** — Family code input with dark slate "What happens next?" info card. Shows informative error (server-side registry not yet implemented)
- **`/welcome` dedicated route** — Unauthenticated users always land on Welcome Gate first; auto-load to Load Pod only triggers after clicking "Sign in to your pod"
- **`LoginBackground.vue`** — Warm gradient (`from-[#F8F9FA] via-[#FEF0E8] to-[#EBF5FD]`), wider `max-w-[580px]`
- **`LoginSecurityFooter.vue`** — Compact inline footer with 4 security badges at `opacity-30`
- **`LoginPage.vue`** — 5-view orchestrator with store initialization on mount, auto-load deferred to navigation
- **Legacy setup wizard removed** — `SetupPage.vue` deleted, `/setup` route removed, create pod wizard handles full onboarding
- **Deleted**: `SignInView.vue`, `TrustBadges.vue`, `SetupPage.vue`
- **~50 new i18n keys** in `uiStrings.ts` under `loginV6.*` namespace

### Encryption Pipeline Security Hardening (Issue #84) — Closed

- **Critical security fix**: 7 bugs in the sync pipeline could cause encrypted `.beanpod` files to be silently written in plaintext
- **`syncService.ts`**: Added `setEncryptionRequiredCallback()` — `triggerDebouncedSave()`, `flushPendingSave()`, and `save()` now refuse to write when encryption is required but no password is available (defense-in-depth)
- **`syncStore.ts`**: Removed hardcoded `encryptionEnabled: false` from `loadFromFile()`, `loadFromNewFile()`, and `disconnect()` — encryption setting now persists correctly across file operations
- **`syncStore.ts`**: `requestPermission()` no longer arms auto-sync before password is available; `decryptPendingFile()` sets password and encryption flag before reloading stores, then arms auto-sync
- **`MobileHamburgerMenu.vue`**: Fixed sign-out order — `signOut()` now flushes pending saves before `resetAllStores()` clears the session password (matching AppHeader pattern)
- **`fileSync.ts`**: `exportToFile()` now respects encryption settings; `importSyncFileData()` preserves local `encryptionEnabled` value instead of importing from file

### Family Member Role Display Fix

- `FamilyBeanRow.vue` `getRoleLabel` now checks `member.ageGroup` (adult/child) instead of only `member.role`
- Adults with 'member' role correctly show "Parent"/"Big Bean" instead of "Little Bean"

### Cross-Device Passkey Authentication Fix (Issue #108) — Superseded

- **Implemented but superseded** by the Automerge + Family Key migration (#119)
- Level 1 (cross-device UX) and Level 2 (PRF-wrapped password in .beanpod) were fully implemented
- The family key model eliminates the cross-device problem entirely — passkeys wrap the family key directly, which is always available in the file envelope
- All #108 code (PasskeySecret type, passkeyCrypto wrapPassword/unwrapPassword, cross-device flow in BiometricLoginView/LoginPage, passkeySecrets in sync layer) will be replaced or removed during the migration (#114, #115, #116)

### Biometric Login After Family Switching (Issue #16 follow-up)

- **LoadPodView.vue** — Added biometric detection before password modal: checks `isPlatformAuthenticatorAvailable()` + `hasRegisteredPasskeys()` when encrypted file is loaded, emits `biometric-available` event to switch to BiometricLoginView
- **LoginPage.vue** — Handles `biometric-available` event from LoadPodView, `biometricDeclined` flag prevents loops when user clicks "Use password instead", resets on family switch/navigation
- **authStore.ts** — Fixed `signInWithPasskey()` using stale `familyContextStore.activeFamilyId` instead of the authoritative `familyId` parameter during family switching
- **passwordCache.test.ts** — Added missing `setSessionDEK` and `flushPendingSave` to syncService mock (pre-existing CI failure)

### Cross-Device Sync (Issue #103) — Closed

- **`syncStore.ts` — `reloadIfFileChanged()`**: Lightweight `getFileTimestamp()` check, full reload only when file is newer. Handles encrypted files via session password → session DEK → cached password fallback chain
- **`syncStore.ts` — `startFilePolling()` / `stopFilePolling()`**: 10-second interval polling for external file changes, auto-started by `setupAutoSync()`, stopped on sign-out/disconnect
- **`App.vue` — visibility change handling**: `reloadIfFileChanged()` on tab/app resume; `syncStore.syncNow(true)` force save on `hidden` to prevent data loss on quick reload
- **Data loss fix**: `flushPendingSave()` + `syncNow(true)` on `visibilityState: hidden` ensures debounced saves are flushed before page reload
- Cloud relay for near-instant sync planned as follow-up (#118, supersedes #104)

### Family Nook Landing Page Fix

- All 5 login components (PickBeanView, BiometricLoginView, JoinPodView, CreatePodView, LoadPodView) now redirect to `/nook` instead of `/dashboard` after sign-in
- NotFoundPage "Go Home" button navigates to `/nook`
- E2E tests updated to expect `/nook` after authentication

### Biometric Login Fallback Fix (LoadPodView)

- Fixed bug where "use password instead" after biometric prompt showed old family members instead of decrypt modal
- Root cause: `autoLoadFile()` called `syncStore.loadFromFile()` reading from old configured file handle instead of pending encrypted file
- Fix: check `syncStore.hasPendingEncryptedFile` before re-reading

### Deploy Workflow CI Gating

- Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to poll for CI/security check completion (15s interval, 10min timeout) instead of failing immediately
- Fails immediately if no CI run exists for the latest commit (prevents bypassing CI)

### NookGreeting UI Cleanup

- Removed duplicate notification bell and privacy mask icons from `NookGreeting.vue` (already present in header)

### Codebase Deduplication & Cleanup (PR #107) — Closed

Comprehensive review of 243 source files (~49,700 lines) identified and consolidated ~2,000+ lines of duplicated or redundant code across 6 phases (84 files changed, net reduction of 544 lines):

- **Shared utilities:** Extracted `currency.ts` (currency conversion, 6 consumers), `useMemberInfo.ts` (member lookup, 5 pages), `toDateInputValue()` (date formatting, 4 files)
- **Generic repository factory:** `createRepository.ts` eliminates identical CRUD boilerplate across 8 IndexedDB repositories (~474 lines)
- **Toast notification system:** `useToast.ts` + `ToastContainer.vue` — module-level singleton for user-visible error/success/warning/info notifications. Error toasts are sticky. Replaces silent `console.error` calls
- **Store action helper:** `wrapAsync()` in `useStoreActions.ts` replaces 23 identical try/catch/finally blocks across 8 stores (~484 lines). CRUD failures automatically show sticky error toasts
- **Member filter factory:** `useMemberFiltered.ts` consolidates 20+ filtered getter patterns across 5 stores
- **Component consolidation:** Unified `MemberChipFilter.vue` (replaced 2 near-identical components), `useFormModal.ts` composable (5 modals), `ActionButtons.vue` (4 pages)
- **CSS cleanup:** 172 hardcoded hex colors replaced with Tailwind semantic tokens, `nook-section-label` utility applied to 8 inline duplicates, shared `nook-card-dark` class for 4 nook widgets
- **Dead code removal:** 6 unused date utility functions removed
- 10 new shared modules created. 462/462 unit tests passed, 54/57 E2E tests passed (1 pre-existing flaky)
- Full plan: `docs/plans/2026-03-01-codebase-dedup-cleanup.md`

### Node.js 24 Upgrade

- Upgraded all CI/CD workflows and `.nvmrc` from Node 20 to Node 24
- Eliminated recurring TypeScript strictness mismatches between local dev (Node 24) and CI (Node 20)
- Removed Node version matrix from `main-ci.yml` (was `[20.x, 24.x]`, now single `24`)
- Fixed `createRepository.ts` TS2352 error exposed by Node 24's stricter TypeScript

### Text Casing Standardization

- Standardized all non-sentence UI text to lowercase across `uiStrings.ts` (~150 strings)
- Fixed AppHeader page title system: reads `route.meta.titleKey` → `t(titleKey)` instead of empty `route.meta.title`
- Dashboard and Nook pages show greeting instead of page title in AppHeader
- Removed duplicate `<h1>` page titles from AccountsPage, TransactionsPage, FamilyPlannerPage, FamilyTodoPage
- Updated E2E planner tests to use case-insensitive matchers
- Documented casing standard in `.claude/skills/beanies-theme.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
- Regenerated Chinese translations for all changed strings

### Budget Page (Issue #68) — Closed

- **Data model** — `Budget`, `BudgetCategory`, `BudgetMode` types in `models.ts`. `CreateBudgetInput`/`UpdateBudgetInput` aliases. `'budget'` added to `EntityType` union. `budgets` added to `SyncFileData.data`
- **Database** — DB_VERSION 5→6. `budgets` object store with `by-memberId` and `by-isActive` indexes. Export/import/clear support
- **`src/services/indexeddb/repositories/budgetRepository.ts`** (new) — Standard `createRepository` pattern + `getActiveBudget()` helper
- **`src/stores/budgetStore.ts`** (new) — Core budget state + cross-store computed getters: `activeBudget`, `effectiveBudgetAmount` (resolves percentage mode), `categoryBudgetStatus` (per-category spend tracking with ok/warning/over), `budgetProgress`, `paceStatus` (great/onTrack/caution/overBudget), `upcomingTransactions` (next 5 recurring), `monthlySavings`, `savingsRate`, recurring/one-time breakdowns
- **`src/components/budget/BudgetSettingsModal.vue`** (new) — BeanieFormModal with mode toggle (% of income / fixed), percentage input with live effective budget preview, fixed amount input, currency selector, FamilyChipPicker for owner, collapsible category allocations with per-category AmountInput
- **`src/components/budget/QuickAddTransactionModal.vue`** (new) — Simplified transaction entry: direction toggle (Money In/Out), hero AmountInput, CategoryChipPicker, description, date, account select
- **`src/pages/BudgetPage.vue`** (new) — Full budget tracking page:
  - Hero card: Deep Slate gradient, Heritage Orange progress bar with time-position marker, motivational message + emoji based on pace
  - 3-column summary cards: Monthly Income, Current Spending, Monthly Savings (with recurring/one-time breakdowns, count-up animation)
  - Two-column content: Upcoming Transactions (next 5 scheduled) + Spending by Category (progress bars, color-coded status)
  - Bottom section: Budget Settings card + Add Transactions card (Quick Add functional, Batch Add + CSV Upload with "beanies in development" badge)
  - Empty state with EmptyStateIllustration when no budget exists
  - Privacy mode, dark mode, and mobile responsive support
- **Router + navigation** — `/budgets` route changed from DashboardPage to BudgetPage. `comingSoon` removed from budgets nav item
- **Sync infrastructure** — Budgets added to mergeService, fileSync validation + change detection, syncStore auto-sync watch + reload, App.vue data loading
- **EmptyStateIllustration** — Added `'budget'` variant with beanie + bar chart SVG
- ~70 new translation strings under `budget.*` namespace with beanie mode overrides
- Plan saved: `docs/plans/2026-03-01-budget-page.md`
- **Bug fixes (post-launch):**
  - Fixed zero spending bug: `isDateBetween()` normalized to date-only string comparison to eliminate timezone-dependent filtering failures
  - Fixed member filter not applied to budget summary cards (income, spending, savings, category breakdowns now use filtered variants)
  - Fixed multi-currency category aggregation (raw amounts now converted via `convertToBaseCurrency()` before summing)
  - Fixed emoji unicode escapes rendering as literal text on Add Transactions card
  - Redesigned Budget Settings card to match v7 UI mockup (side-by-side mode cards, Heritage Orange info callout)

### Recent Fixes

- **Multi-family isolation hardening** — Fixed cross-family data leakage when authenticated user's familyId could not be resolved:
  - Added cached session familyId as 4th fallback in auth resolution chain (JWT → getUserAttributes → registry → cached session)
  - Authenticated users no longer fall back to `lastActiveFamilyId` (which could belong to a different user)
  - Placeholder family creation now uses auth-resolved ID instead of random UUID (`createFamilyWithId()`)
  - Sync service refuses to load sync file whose `familyId` doesn't match the active family (in `loadAndImport`, `openAndLoadFile`, `decryptAndImport`)
  - Sync service skips initialization when no active family is set (prevents legacy key fallback)
  - Sync service `reset()` clears stale file handles and session passwords on family switch
  - Sync service tracks `currentFileHandleFamilyId` — `save()` blocks writes if handle belongs to a different family
  - Added `closeDatabase()` before loading family data to ensure clean DB connection
  - 22 multi-family isolation tests (up from 19)
- **BaseModal scroll fix** — Modal body now uses `flex-1 overflow-y-auto` with `max-h-[calc(100vh-2rem)]` so tall content scrolls instead of overflowing below the viewport (discovered via asset loan form E2E tests)
- Restored ReportsPage that was wiped during bulk ESLint/Prettier formatting
- Added data-testid attributes to transaction items and account cards for E2E tests
- Fixed E2E tests to switch to transactions tab before interacting with elements
- Switched from idb library to native IndexedDB APIs

### AWS Infrastructure & Deployment (Issue #7) — Closed

- **Terraform IaC** (`infrastructure/`) — Modular Terraform configuration with S3 backend + DynamoDB locking
  - `frontend` module: S3 bucket (CloudFront OAC), CloudFront distribution (HTTPS, gzip, SPA routing), ACM cert (DNS-validated), Route53 A/AAAA records
- **CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) — Two-job GitHub Actions workflow:
  - `test` job: lint, type-check, Vitest unit tests, Playwright E2E (chromium), production build
  - `deploy` job: S3 sync + CloudFront cache invalidation (only runs after tests pass)
  - All secrets (AWS credentials, S3 bucket, CloudFront ID) stored in GitHub Secrets
- **Live at** `https://beanies.family` (and `https://www.beanies.family`)
- All sub-issues closed: #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14

## In Progress

- **Multi-Family with File-Based Auth** — Per-family databases, file-based authentication (Cognito removed), passkey/biometric login implemented

### Completed Goals Section (Issue #55)

- Collapsible "Completed Goals" disclosure section below active goals list (collapsed by default)
- Completed goals sorted by most recently completed, showing name, type, member, completion date, and final amounts
- Reopen button moves a goal back to the active list; delete button removes with whoosh sound
- Muted styling distinguishes completed from active goals; privacy mode blur on amounts
- Renamed "All Goals" card to "Active Goals" for clarity
- 3 new translation keys with beanie mode overrides (`goals.reopenGoal`, `goals.noCompletedGoals`, `goals.completedOn`)

### Financial Institution Dropdown (Issue #42) — Closed

- **`BaseCombobox.vue`** — Reusable searchable single-select dropdown with "Other" support, custom text input, clear button, backward compatibility for free-text values
- **`src/constants/institutions.ts`** — 22 predefined global banks (BoA, HSBC, DBS, JPMorgan Chase, etc.) with name/shortName
- **`src/constants/countries.ts`** — 249 ISO 3166-1 countries for optional country selector
- **`useInstitutionOptions`** composable merges predefined + user-saved custom institutions into sorted dropdown options
- Replaced plain text institution input on AccountsPage (add + edit modals) with institution combobox + country combobox
- Replaced plain text lender input on AssetsPage loan section (add + edit modals) with institution combobox + country combobox
- Custom institutions only persisted when form is saved (not on typing); deletable from dropdown with X button
- Deleting a custom institution clears it from all linked accounts and asset loans
- `institutionCountry` added to Account, `lenderCountry` added to AssetLoan, `customInstitutions` added to Settings
- 7 new translation keys with beanie mode overrides
- **E2E tests** (8 tests): predefined selection, search/filter, custom "Other" entry, country selection, edit pre-population, shared custom institutions across accounts and assets
- **`ComboboxHelper`** E2E helper class and **`AssetsPage`** page object created
- **BaseModal scroll fix**: tall modal content (e.g. asset loan form) now scrolls instead of overflowing below viewport

### Beanie Language Mode (Issue #35) — Closed

- Optional beanie mode toggle in Settings replacing standard UI strings with friendly bean-themed alternatives
- Single source of truth `STRING_DEFS` in `uiStrings.ts` with side-by-side `en` + `beanie` fields
- `t()` resolution: beanie override applied only when `language === 'en'` and `beanieMode === true`
- Translation pipeline always sources from plain English `UI_STRINGS` (hard requirement)
- Toggle disabled and greyed out when non-English language is active
- ~100+ beanie string overrides across all pages
- Unit tests and E2E tests (4 specs)

## v6 UI Framework Proposal

A v6 UI framework proposal has been uploaded to `docs/brand/beanies-ui-framework-proposal-v6.html`, superseding v5 with detailed login flow screens for the new file-based authentication model. The v3 proposal was previously removed as obsolete.

v6 introduces a **six-screen authentication flow** built around the Pod concept (encrypted `.beanpod` data files):

- **00a: Welcome Gate** — Three paths: sign in, create pod, join pod
- **00b: Load Your Pod** — File picker + drag-drop zone + cloud storage connectors (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud)
- **00b-2: Unlock Your Pod** — Decrypt loaded file with pod password
- **00b-3: Pick Your Bean** — Family member selection with 88px avatars and onboarding status indicators
- **00c: Create a New Pod** — 3-step wizard (name/password → storage → invite)
- **00d: Join an Existing Pod** — Family code or magic link entry

Additionally, v6 includes all previous v4/v5 screens: Dashboard, Accounts (card + list), Budgets, Transactions, Onboarding, Family Hub, Mobile (4 phone mockups), Landing Page, and Settings.

| Issue | Screen                                                               | Status     |

## v7 UI Framework Proposal

A v7 UI framework proposal has been uploaded to `docs/brand/beanies-ui-framework-proposal-v7.html`, introducing a major structural reorganisation: the app shifts from finance-first to **family-first**, with three new pages and a collapsible accordion sidebar.

### Key Changes in v7

1. **Sidebar accordion restructure** — Flat nav replaced with two collapsible sections:
   - **The Piggy Bank 🐷** (finance): Overview, Accounts, Budgets, Transactions
   - **The Treehouse 🌳** (family): Family Nook, Family Planner, Family To-Do, Family Hub
   - Settings pinned at bottom, outside both accordions

2. **Family Nook 🏡** — New home screen after login (replaces finance dashboard as entry point). Shows today's schedule, events, milestones, activity feed, shared to-do widget, and Piggy Bank quick-access card

3. **Family Planner 📅** — Calendar and scheduling hub absorbing the old Family Hub calendar. Month/week/day/agenda views, event categorisation, family member filtering

4. **Family To-Do ✅** — Standalone task management page at `/todo`. Quick-add, assignees, date integration with calendar. Purple (#9B59B6) accent colour for to-do elements

5. **Updated mobile bottom tab bar** — 5 tabs: 🏡 Nook, 📅 Planner, 🐷 Piggy Bank, 📋 Budget, 👨‍👩‍👦 Pod

6. **Family Hub updated** — Calendar removed (→ Family Planner), now focused on personal member activity and milestones

7. **Budget page enhancements** — 3 transaction entry methods (Quick Add, Batch Add, CSV Upload), time-position marker, motivational emoji messages, category spending bars

8. **Transactions ledger** — Recurring/one-time type pills, summary pills, enhanced add modal with recurring toggle
