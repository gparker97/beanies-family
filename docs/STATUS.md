> **Updated by:** Claude (Weekly calendar view, all-day activities, shared component extractions)

## Current Phase

**Phase 1 — MVP** (In Progress)

## Completed Work

### Infrastructure

- Project scaffold with Vite + Vue 3 + TypeScript
- IndexedDB service with repositories (native IndexedDB APIs)
- Pinia stores for all entities (family, accounts, transactions, assets, goals, settings, sync, recurring, translation, memberFilter)
- Vue Router with all page routes (lazy-loaded)
- Dark mode / theme support
- E2E test infrastructure (Playwright — Chromium/Firefox/WebKit)
- Unit test infrastructure (Vitest with happy-dom)
- Linting (ESLint + Prettier + Stylelint + Husky pre-commit hooks)
- File-based sync via File System Access API (with encryption support)
- Google Drive cloud storage integration (StorageProvider abstraction, OAuth PKCE with Lambda proxy, Drive REST API, offline queue, file picker, Google Picker API for join flow, email sharing via Drive Permissions API, reconnect toast, scope validation, cross-account folder cache fix, PWA re-consent loop fix with persistent storage + localStorage token fallback) — ADR-016, #112
- OAuth Lambda proxy (`beanies-family-oauth-prod`) — stateless token exchange & refresh at `api.beanies.family/oauth/google/*`, keeps client_secret server-side
- IndexedDB naming convention: `beanies-data-{familyId}`, `beanies-registry`, `beanies-file-handles` (migrated from `gp-finance-*`)
- Cross-device sync hardening: record-level merge (v3.0 file format), deletion tombstones, 6 sync bug fixes — ADR-017
- Exchange rate auto-fetching from free currency API
- Recurring transaction processor (daily/monthly/yearly)
- Multilingual support (English + Chinese) via MyMemory API with IndexedDB caching
- Project documentation: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/adr/` (13 ADRs)
- Generic IndexedDB repository factory (`createRepository.ts`) — shared CRUD for 8 entity stores
- Toast notification system (`useToast.ts` + `ToastContainer.vue`) — error/success/warning/info toasts
- Store action helper (`wrapAsync()`) — centralized try/catch/finally for all store CRUD operations
- Node.js 24 across all CI/CD workflows and local development
- Family key encryption service: AES-256-GCM family key with AES-KW per-member wrapping, invite link service, v4.0 beanpod file format types, QR code utility, shared encoding helpers (#111)
- Permission roles: `canViewFinances`, `canEditActivities`, `canManagePod` fields on FamilyMember, `usePermissions()` composable, route guards, sidebar/mobile nav filtering, readOnly modal pattern, NoAccessPage (#132)

### UI Components

- Base component library: BaseButton, BaseCard, BaseCombobox, BaseInput, BaseModal, BaseSelect
- AppHeader, AppSidebar layout components

### Pages / Features

- Dashboard with summary cards (combined one-time + recurring totals)
- Accounts management (full CRUD, card-based layout)
- Transactions management (full CRUD, with date filter, category icons, projected recurring transactions, Today button on month navigator)
- Assets management (full CRUD, loan tracking, combined net worth)
- Goals management (full CRUD, collapsible completed goals section)
- Reports page (net worth, income vs expenses, extended date ranges, category breakdowns)
- Family member management (global member filter)
- Settings page (currency, theme, sync, encryption)
- First-run setup wizard
- Multi-currency display with global display currency selector
- Family Nook home screen (`/nook`) — greeting, status toast, family beans row, schedule cards (merged todos + planner activities with view-first modals), inline todo widget with view/edit modals, milestones, piggy bank card, recent activity feed (view-first modals for todos + transactions). Overdue task detection with orange pill + ⏰ indicator. Task description preview (2-line clamp) on cards. `/` redirects to `/nook`
- Family Hub / Bean Pod (`/family`) — v7 redesign (#73): 3-column layout (sidebar, member cards, quick-info panel), activity-focused member cards (upcoming events, milestones, activity count, tasks — no financial data), role tags ("Parent Bean"/"Little Bean"), Heritage Orange selected state, events this week panel. Calendar removed (→ Family Planner #98)
- Landing page (`/home`) — full implementation from mockup (#72): hero with hugging beanie mascot + animated headline, 3 floating device screenshots (Nook, Piggy Bank, Planner), trust badges, security section with 6 cards, Greg's full beanies story, animated CTA with celebrating beanies circle, footer with Slack-wired contact form (`VITE_CONTACT_WEBHOOK_URL`), scroll progress bar, IntersectionObserver reveal animations, smooth-scroll anchor navigation, back-to-top button. Scoped CSS (not Tailwind) for pixel-perfect mockup fidelity. Decorative brand character images as low-opacity background accents. E2E tests updated.

### Weekly Calendar View & Planner Enhancements (2026-03-17)

- **Weekly calendar view** (`WeeklyCalendarView.vue`): 7-column hourly time grid with activity blocks positioned at time slots, current time indicator, auto-scroll to now. Mobile: horizontal day tab strip with card list
- **Shared component extractions (DRY)**: `ActivityListCard.vue` (eliminated 3× card duplication), `CalendarNavBar.vue` (shared prev/next/today nav), `useCalendarNavigation.ts` composable (week navigation + time grid positioning + overlap grouping)
- **All-day activities**: `isAllDay` and `endDate` fields on FamilyActivity model. ActivityModal checkbox to toggle all-day mode (hides time pickers, shows optional end date for multi-day). Multi-day all-day activities span across day columns as a single bar in weekly view
- **TodoItemRow shared component**: Extracted from TodoItemCard and NookTodoWidget, reused in DayAgendaSidebar and weekly view for todo display
- **DayAgendaSidebar enhanced**: Added "Tasks Due" purple section showing todos for selected date
- **Form validation UX**: `FormFieldGroup` error prop with orange ring highlight. ActivityModal highlights missing required fields on save attempt instead of disabling save button
- **InlineEditField z-index fix**: Active edit controls layer above neighboring grid cells
- **Todo modal button**: Changed "Done" to "Close" in TodoViewEditModal to avoid confusion with completing
- **ViewToggle**: Removed day/agenda options (redundant with weekly + sidebar). Default view changed to week
- **E2E tests updated**: Planner tests adapted for week-view default with scoped selectors
- Plan: `docs/plans/2026-03-17-weekly-daily-calendar-views.md`

### Assets Page Visual Polish (2026-03-13)

- **Stat card subtexts**: All 4 SummaryStatCards on Assets page now show contextual subtitles (asset count, active loan count, "After loan deductions", appreciation %)
- **Equity progress bar**: Green gradient bar above loan panel showing equity % for assets with loans
- **Loan panel restructure**: Header row with label + amount side-by-side, 2-column detail grid below
- **Card stagger animation**: `fade-slide-up` keyframe extracted from GoalsPage to global `style.css` for reuse, cards animate in with 70ms stagger delay
- **Card hover effects**: `group-hover:scale-[1.08]` on icon, `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100` on action dots
- **Notes quote style**: `border-l-2 border-gray-200 pl-3` left-border quote styling
- **SummaryStatCard fix**: Subtitle font `text-[10px]` → `text-xs` (CIG min 12px), label/subtitle stacked vertically instead of horizontal to prevent wrapping
- **InfoHintBadge fix**: Rewrote from `position: absolute` to `<Teleport to="body">` with `position: fixed` to escape `overflow-auto` clipping on `<main>`
- 4 new translation keys: `assets.equity`, `assets.activeLoans`, `assets.afterLoanDeductions`, `assets.overall`
- Plan: `docs/plans/2026-03-13-assets-page-visual-polish.md`

### Goals & Assets Page Revamp (2026-03-13)

- **GoalsPage rewrite**: Sectioned layout with group-by toggle (member/priority), encouragement messages, milestone dots, "almost there" glow, achieved goals section
- **AssetModal extraction**: Extracted ~720 lines of duplicated inline modal forms from AssetsPage into `AssetModal.vue` component
- **DRY fix**: `persistCustomInstitutionIfNeeded` moved to shared `useInstitutionOptions.ts` composable
- **SummaryStatCard**: Added `rawValue` prop for non-currency display (goal counts)

### E2E Shared UI String Resolver (2026-03-13)

- **`e2e/helpers/ui-strings.ts`**: Shared resolver that imports `UI_STRINGS` from the app's translation system, so E2E tests reference translation keys instead of hardcoded English strings
- **ComboboxHelper fix**: Updated constructor to handle both BaseCombobox wrapper (`.relative.space-y-1`) and FormFieldGroup wrapper (`.space-y-2`) using `.or()` pattern
- **Full migration**: All E2E helpers, page objects, and spec files migrated to use `ui()` — covers auth.ts, AccountsPage, TransactionsPage, AssetsPage, and 8 spec files
- Strings without matching uiStrings keys (setup flow form labels, brand tagline, beanie-mode assertions) left as-is

### Beanie Brand Asset Icons

- `beanies_covering_eyes_transparent_512x512.png` — replaces all lock/closed-padlock SVG icons (privacy mode active, data encrypted, data hidden)
- `beanies_open_eyes_transparent_512x512.png` — replaces all open-padlock SVG icons (privacy mode off, data visible, data unencrypted)
- `beanies_impact_bullet_transparent_192x192.png` — replaces warning/alert/exclamation SVG icons and all feature bullet point icons (SyncStatusIndicator warning, PasskeySettings alert, LoginPage security bullets, SetupPage security bullets)
- Theme skill (`.claude/skills/beanies-theme.md`) updated with icon usage guide

### Centralized Icon System (Issue #44)

- **`src/constants/icons.ts`** — Central registry of ~72 beanie-styled SVG icon definitions with `BeanieIconDef` type. Organized into: NAV (9), ACTION (8), SUMMARY (5), UTILITY (10), STATUS (4), CATEGORY (28), ACCOUNT_TYPE (8), ASSET_TYPE (9). Helper functions: `getIconDef()`, `getAccountTypeIcon()`, `getAssetTypeIcon()`
- **`src/components/ui/BeanieIcon.vue`** — Universal icon component enforcing brand style (stroke-width 1.75, round linecap/linejoin). Props: `name`, `size` (xs/sm/md/lg/xl), `strokeWidth`. Falls back to three-dot circle for unknown icons
- **`src/components/common/PageHeader.vue`** — Shared page header with 40px rounded-xl icon container + title + subtitle + action slot
- **15 files migrated** — All inline SVGs replaced with BeanieIcon in: AppSidebar, AppHeader, BaseModal, CategoryIcon, AccountTypeIcon, DashboardPage, AccountsPage, TransactionsPage, AssetsPage, GoalsPage, ReportsPage, ForecastPage, FamilyPage, SettingsPage
- CategoryIcon.vue reduced from ~365 lines to ~45 lines (19-branch v-if chain → single BeanieIcon)
- AccountsPage reduced from 893 to ~591 lines; AssetsPage collapsed 2x 9-branch asset type icon chains
- Zero inline `<svg>` elements remaining in all migrated files

### Micro-Animations (Issue #45)

- Page header icon bounce on load, sidebar hover wobble/scale, card hover lift
- Summary card count-up animation, goal progress bar fill animation
- Empty state floating/breathing animation
- Privacy toggle beanie blink, theme toggle rotation
- All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- CSS `@keyframes` using hardware-accelerated `transform` + `opacity`

### Empty State Beanie Illustrations (Issue #47)

- Beanie character illustrations for all empty states: accounts, transactions, recurring, assets, goals, reports, dashboard
- `EmptyStateIllustration.vue` component with variant prop
- Stored in `public/brand/empty-states/`

### 404 Page Redesign (Issue #48)

- Full beanie-themed 404 page with lost beanie illustration
- Playful heading and encouraging subtext, brand-styled CTA

### Loading States with Brand Spinner (Issue #49)

- `BeanieSpinner.vue` component using `beanies_spinner_transparent_192x192.png`
- Brand spinner for all loading states (app load, language switching, data fetch, button loading)
- Loading text: "counting beans..." (never "Loading...")

### Forecast "Coming Soon" Redesign (Issue #50)

- Beanie with telescope illustration
- Warm brand-voice copy, beanie impact bullet icons for feature list

### Sound Effects System (Issue #46)

- **`src/composables/useSounds.ts`** — Web Audio API synthesised sounds (zero bundle size, sub-ms latency)
- 6 sound functions: `playPop()`, `playClink()`, `playChime()`, `playFanfare()`, `playWhoosh()`, `playBlink()`
- `soundEnabled` global setting (defaults to `true`) with toggle in Settings > General
- AudioContext created lazily on first user gesture (browser autoplay compliance)
- Celebration integration: `playChime()` on toast celebrations, `playFanfare()` on modal celebrations
- Delete actions: `playWhoosh()` on account/transaction/recurring/asset/goal deletes
- Privacy toggle: `playBlink()` on header privacy eye toggle
- App.vue watcher syncs `soundEnabled` setting to composable
- Goal completion detection fixed: `updateGoal()` now detects completion transitions and fires celebrations (previously only `updateProgress()` did, which was never called from UI)
- Goals empty state fixed: shows when all goals are completed (was checking all goals instead of active goals)
- Celebration toast image enlarged from 40px to 80px
- Unit tests (5) and E2E tests (3)

### Multi-Family Architecture (Stage 1)

- Per-family database architecture: each family gets its own IndexedDB (`beanies-data-{familyId}`)
- Registry database (`beanies-registry`): stores families, user mappings, global settings
- Family context orchestrator (`familyContext.ts`) and Pinia store (`familyContextStore.ts`)
- Legacy migration service: auto-migrates single-DB data to per-family DB on first boot
- Global settings split from per-family settings (theme, language, exchange rates are device-level)
- Sync file format v2.0: includes `familyId` and `familyName` (backward-compatible with v1.0)
- Per-family file handle storage for sync
- New types: `Family`, `UserFamilyMapping`, `GlobalSettings`
- All existing repositories work unchanged (transparent multi-tenancy via `getDatabase()`)
- E2E test helpers updated for dynamic per-family DB discovery

### File-Based Authentication (replacing Cognito)

- **Password service** (`src/services/auth/passwordService.ts`): PBKDF2 hashing (100k iterations, SHA-256, 16-byte salt, 32-byte hash) with constant-time verification
- **Auth store** (`src/stores/authStore.ts`): complete rewrite — signIn (member picker + password), signUp (owner creates pod), setPassword (joiner onboarding), signOut
- **Login flow**: WelcomeGate → LoadPodView (file picker + decrypt modal) → PickBeanView (member picker + password) / CreatePodView (3-step wizard) / JoinPodView (family code entry)
- **Data model**: `passwordHash` and `requiresPassword` fields on `FamilyMember`
- Route guards: all app routes have `requiresAuth: true`, login route exempt
- App.vue bootstrap simplified: global settings → auth init → family resolution → data load
- ADR-014 (file-based auth decision), supersedes ADR-010 and ADR-013

### Passkey / Biometric Authentication (Issue #16)

- `passkeyCrypto.ts`: PRF helpers, HKDF key derivation, AES-KW DEK wrapping/unwrapping
- `passkeyService.ts`: Full WebAuthn registration + assertion with PRF and non-PRF paths
- `passkeyRepository.ts`: IndexedDB CRUD for passkey registrations (registry DB v3)
- Dual-path strategy: PRF (true passwordless) + cached password fallback (Firefox)
- `BiometricLoginView.vue`: One-tap biometric login on returning devices
- `PasskeyPromptModal.vue`: Post-sign-in prompt to enable biometric login
- `PasskeySettings.vue`: Full management UI (register, list, remove passkeys)
- Password change invalidates PRF-wrapped DEKs, updates cached passwords
- ADR-015 documents the architectural decision
- `PasskeySettings.vue` component: lists registered passkeys, register new, remove existing
- Requires server-side challenge generation for full flow (deferred)

### Cognito Removal

- Deleted: `src/config/cognito.ts`, `src/services/auth/cognitoService.ts`, `src/services/auth/tokenManager.ts`, `src/services/auth/index.ts`, `src/services/api/adminApi.ts`
- Deleted: `src/pages/MagicLinkCallbackPage.vue`, `src/components/login/VerificationCodeForm.vue`, `src/components/family/CreateMemberAccountModal.vue`
- Deleted: `infrastructure/modules/auth/` (Cognito User Pool), `infrastructure/modules/api/` (Lambda + API Gateway), `infrastructure/scripts/cognito-sync-check.sh`
- Removed `amazon-cognito-identity-js` package (~165KB bundle reduction)
- Removed `cachedSessions` object store from registry database (v1 → v2 migration)
- Removed `CachedAuthSession` type, `isLocalOnly` from `UserFamilyMapping`, `isLocalOnlyMode` from `GlobalSettings`
- Removed Cognito env vars from `.env.example`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, `vite.config.ts`

### File-First Architecture

- Encrypted data file is the source of truth; IndexedDB is a temporary cache deleted on sign-out
- Sign-out cleanup: `deleteFamilyDatabase()`, `resetState()` on all data stores, file handle preserved
- App startup always loads from data file when configured; IndexedDB fallback only when file permission not yet granted
- Auto-sync always on when file is configured (no toggle)
- Setup wizard adds Step 3 "Secure Your Data": requires file creation with encryption password
- Default `encryptionEnabled` changed to `true`
- Settings renamed "File Sync" → "Family Data Options"; removed Sync Now, Disconnect, Auto-sync toggle
- Encryption toggle warns before disabling
- SyncStatusIndicator: "Syncing..." → "Saving...", "Synced to..." → "Data saved to..."
- Login page: three security benefit bullet points (encrypted file, no server storage, cloud backup via folder)
- ADR-011: file-first architecture decision record

### beanies.family Rebranding (Issue #22)

- Renamed app from "GP Family Planner" to `beanies.family` across all UI, metadata, and configuration
- Updated `index.html` title and Google Fonts (Outfit + Inter replacing Poppins)
- Updated `vite.config.ts` PWA manifest: name, short_name, description, theme_color, background_color

- Updated AppSidebar: beanies logo, brand wordmark, Outfit font, primary active states
- Updated AppHeader: primary colours for active states and privacy toggle
- Updated all 12 page files: brand colours, brand name, brand backgrounds
- Added `CelebrationOverlay.vue` component with toast (4s auto-dismiss) and modal modes
- Added `useCelebration` composable with six celebration triggers wired to key app events:
  - Setup complete, first file save, first account, first transaction, goal reached, debt paid off
- Added pod spinner loading overlay in `App.vue` ("counting beans..." copy)
- Added project-local skill `.claude/skills/beanies-theme.md`

### Beanie Character Avatars (Issue #39) — Closed

- **`src/constants/avatars.ts`** — 8 SVG avatar variant definitions (`adult-male`, `adult-female`, `adult-other`, `child-male`, `child-female`, `child-other`, `family-group`, `family-filtered`). Bean/pill body shapes with dot eyes, arc smiles. All children wear beanie hats (brand signature). Adults have optional cap (male), bow + shoulder-length hair (female), or clean body (other). Female variants have full hair dome + flowing side strands + clear bowtie (two triangles meeting at a point)
- **`src/components/ui/BeanieAvatar.vue`** — Avatar rendering component with `variant`, `color`, `size` (xs/sm/md/lg/xl), `ariaLabel` props. Renders inline SVG filled with member's profile color, features in Deep Slate. `family-group` renders 4 distinct characters (2 adults + 2 children with beanies) in brand colors (Heritage Orange, Sky Silk, Terracotta, Soft Teal). `family-filtered` renders bean + funnel overlay
- **`src/composables/useMemberAvatar.ts`** — `getAvatarVariant(gender, ageGroup)`, `getMemberAvatarVariant(member)` (with defaults for legacy records), reactive `useMemberAvatar(memberRef)` and `useFilterAvatar(allSelectedRef)` composables
- **Data model** — Added `Gender` (`male`|`female`|`other`), `AgeGroup` (`adult`|`child`), and optional `DateOfBirth` (`{ month, day, year? }`) to `FamilyMember` interface
- **Repository migration** — `applyDefaults()` in `familyMemberRepository.ts` ensures legacy records get `gender: 'other'`, `ageGroup: 'adult'`
- **FamilyPage** — Gender + age group selects (Male/Female/Other, default Male), date of birth dropdowns (month Jan-Dec, day 1-31, optional year), live avatar preview in add/edit member modals. Member cards show BeanieAvatar instead of initial circles. Full edit member modal with pencil icon on each card
- **Header filter icons** — MemberFilterDropdown trigger shows: family-group BeanieAvatar (lg) + "all" when all selected, individual member avatar + name when one selected, filtered icon + count for partial selection. Borderless trigger style (no border/background, tight spacing with arrow)
- **BaseMultiSelect** — Added `#trigger` and `#option` scoped slots + `borderless` prop (backward compatible)
- **BaseSelect** — Fixed right padding (`pl-3 pr-8`) so dropdown arrow is always visible
- **AppHeader** — Profile avatar replaced with BeanieAvatar (falls back to `adult-other`)
- **SetupPage + AuthStore** — Default `gender: 'male'`, `ageGroup: 'adult'` for owner creation
- 15 new translation keys with beanie mode overrides
- Unit tests: 14 tests (composable + avatar definitions)
- E2E tests: 4 specs (header avatar, family cards, add child member, filter dropdown)

### Sidebar Redesign (Issue #59)

- **`src/constants/navigation.ts`** — Shared `NavItemDef` interface and `NAV_ITEMS` array with `PRIMARY_NAV_ITEMS`/`SECONDARY_NAV_ITEMS` exports. Emoji icons, primary/secondary section split. Ready for reuse by mobile bottom nav
- **`src/components/common/AppSidebar.vue`** — Full v3 redesign:
  - Permanent Deep Slate (`#2C3E50`) background — always dark, no light/dark toggle needed
  - Brand logo in 42px squircle with `bg-white/[0.08]` tint
  - Wordmark: "beanies" white + ".family" Heritage Orange, italic tagline at 0.5rem/25% opacity
  - Emoji nav icons replacing BeanieIcon SVGs for warmth (per CIG v2)
  - Active nav item: Heritage Orange gradient (`from-[rgba(241,93,34,0.2)]`) + 4px left border
  - Hover: subtle `bg-white/[0.05]` with text brightening from 40% to 70%
  - Primary/secondary nav separated by `h-px bg-white/[0.08]` divider
  - User profile card at bottom: BeanieAvatar + owner name/role in `bg-white/[0.04]` rounded card
  - Security indicators at 30% opacity ("felt not seen"): file icon + name, lock/unlock, version
  - Removed: `SyncStatusIndicator` component, `BeanieIcon` import, `hoveredPath` ref, hover event listeners, all dark mode conditional classes

### Header Redesign (Issue #67) — Closed

- Removed bottom border, background color, and theme toggle from header
- Page title moved into header left side (Dashboard shows greeting, other pages show `route.meta.title`)
- Removed `PageHeader` component from 7 pages (Accounts, Transactions, Assets, Goals, Reports, Forecast, Settings)
- All controls restyled as squircle containers (`h-10 w-10 rounded-[14px]`) with subtle hover backgrounds
- Currency selector: symbol only (e.g. `$`), language selector: flag only
- Privacy toggle: green status dot (`bg-[#27AE60]`) when figures visible
- Notification bell: BeanieIcon with Heritage Orange dot (static for now)
- Profile: avatar + chevron only, name/email shown in dropdown panel
- `bell` icon added to `UTILITY_ICONS` in `icons.ts`

### Configurable Currency Chips (Issue #36) — Closed

- `preferredCurrencies` added to Settings model and IndexedDB repository
- Settings page: multi-select for up to 4 preferred currencies with removable chips
- Header: inline currency chips in white-bg pill — active chip in Heritage Orange, click to switch instantly
- All currency dropdowns show preferred currencies first via shared `useCurrencyOptions()` composable
- Fallback to baseCurrency if active display currency is removed from preferred list

### Branded Language Picker Flags (Issue #38) — Closed

- SVG flag images (`/brand/flags/us.svg`, `/brand/flags/cn.svg`) for cross-platform rendering (emoji flags don't render on Windows)
- Language picker uses `<img>` tags with SVG flags in white-bg pill + chevron
- Dropdown rows show flag in squircle container + native name with Heritage Orange active highlight
- `flagIcon` field added to `LanguageInfo` interface

### Design System Foundation (Issue #57) — Closed

- All dashboard components created: NetWorthHeroCard, SummaryStatCard, GoalProgressItem, ActivityItem, FamilyBeanRow, RecurringSummaryWidget
- UI components: ToggleSwitch, ToastNotification, BeanieAvatar
- CSS custom properties (--card-shadow, --sq, --silk10, etc.) added to style.css
- v3 Nook UI styling: 24px rounded corners, soft shadows, gradient cards, Heritage Orange accents

### Dashboard Redesign (Issue #58) — Closed

- 3 Summary stat cards (Income / Expenses / Cash Flow) in grid layout
- Family Beans row with beanie avatars, role labels, and Add Bean button
- 2-column grid: Savings Goals with progress bars + Recurring Summary widget
- All cards use v3 rounded-3xl styling with hover lift

### i18n Full String Extraction

- Audited all 15+ Vue files, extracted ~200 hardcoded English strings to `uiStrings.ts`
- All UI text now uses `t('key')` translation calls — enables Chinese translation and beanie mode for all strings
- Files updated: DashboardPage, AppHeader, AppSidebar, SettingsPage, TransactionsPage, ReportsPage, FamilyPage, SetupPage, LoginPage, MagicLinkCallbackPage, PasswordModal, FamilyBeanRow, RecurringSummaryWidget, NetWorthHeroCard
- Project documentation updated: all new UI text must use the translation system, never hardcoded

### Net Worth Chart Axis Labels

- Y-axis compact labels with currency symbol (e.g. `$125k`, `$1.2M`)
- X-axis date labels with Outfit font, last label shows "Today"
- Horizontal grid lines at 4% white opacity
- Chart height increased from h-20 to h-28

### Plans Archive

- `docs/plans/` directory created with naming convention and workflow documentation
- Accepted implementation plans saved before work begins for historical reference
- Rule added to CLAUDE.md project documentation

### Performance Reference Document

- `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` created covering client-side resource boundaries, growth projections, and 8 prioritized mitigation strategies
- Published to GitHub wiki

### Family Member Role Display Fix

- `FamilyBeanRow.vue` `getRoleLabel` now checks `member.ageGroup` (adult/child) instead of only `member.role`
- Adults with 'member' role correctly show "Parent"/"Big Bean" instead of "Little Bean"

### Functional Net Worth Chart (Issue #66) — Closed

- **`src/composables/useNetWorthHistory.ts`** — Computes historical net worth by replaying transactions backwards from current account balances. Supports 5 time periods (1W daily, 1M daily, 3M every 3 days, 1Y biweekly, All auto-scaled ~30 points). Returns period-over-period change amount and percentage. Computes last-month vs this-month deltas for income, expenses, and cash flow. Respects global member filter
- **`NetWorthHeroCard.vue`** — Static SVG sparkline replaced with Chart.js `<Line>` area chart via vue-chartjs. Heritage Orange line (`#F15D22`) with gradient fill (30% → transparent). Subtle grid lines at 4% white opacity. Glowing dot marks current value. Period pills now functional — clicking changes chart range and recomputes comparison. Dynamic period label ("this week"/"this month"/"past 3 months"/"this year"/"all time"). Privacy mode shows "Chart hidden" placeholder. Empty state shows "No data yet". Custom tooltip with brand styling
- **`DashboardPage.vue`** — Wired up composable: `changeAmount`/`changePercent`/`selectedPeriod`/`historyData` to hero card, `incomeChange`/`expenseChange`/`cashFlowChange` to summary stat cards for "vs last month" comparison
- Assets treated as constant in history (no historical valuation data in MVP)

### PNG Brand Character Avatars (Issue #65) — Closed

- Replaced inline SVG avatar rendering with hand-crafted PNG brand assets from `public/brand/`
- **`BeanieAvatar.vue`** — Rewritten from `<svg>` to `<div>` + `<img>`. Each avatar shows colored ring border (2px solid in member's color) + soft pastel background (member color at ~12% opacity). `family-filtered` variant shows small funnel badge overlay (SVG icon in dark circle)
- **`avatars.ts`** — Removed `BeanieAvatarDef` interface, `BEANIE_AVATARS` SVG paths, `getAvatarDef()`. Replaced with `AVATAR_IMAGE_PATHS` mapping variants to PNG paths, `getAvatarImagePath()`. `AvatarVariant` type preserved
- PNG asset mapping: `adult-male` → father, `adult-female` → mother, `child-male` → baby boy, `child-female` → baby girl, `adult-other`/`child-other` → neutral, `family-group` → family, `family-filtered` → neutral + funnel badge
- Unit tests rewritten (8 tests — PNG path assertions replace SVG path assertions)
- E2E tests updated to check for `<img>` elements with `/brand/beanies_*.png` sources

### Branded Confirmation Modal (Issue #56) — Closed

- `useConfirm` composable (singleton pattern matching `useCelebration`): `confirm()` and `alert()` return `Promise<boolean>`
- `ConfirmModal.vue` component wrapping `BaseModal` + `BaseButton` + `BeanieIcon` with danger (red) and info (orange) variants
- All 9 native `confirm()`/`alert()` calls replaced across 6 files (Accounts, Transactions, Assets, Goals, Family, PasskeySettings)
- 14 new i18n keys for dialog titles and messages with beanie mode overrides
- Wired into `App.vue` alongside `CelebrationOverlay`

### Dashboard Count-Up Animation Restore

- Re-integrated `useCountUp` composable into `SummaryStatCard` for animated number transitions
- Animation triggers on page load, view switching (component remount), and privacy mode reveal (target returns 0 when masked)
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility setting

### Blurred Masked Chart

- Dashboard net worth chart shows blurred view (`blur-md`) instead of "chart hidden" placeholder when privacy masking is on
- Matches Reports page pattern; `pointer-events-none` prevents tooltip data leaks
- Smooth CSS transition (`transition-all duration-300`) between blurred and clear states

### Mobile Responsive Layout (Issue #63)

- **`src/composables/useBreakpoint.ts`** — Reactive `isMobile` / `isTablet` / `isDesktop` refs using `matchMedia` with singleton listeners, SSR-safe defaults
- **`src/components/common/MobileBottomNav.vue`** — Fixed bottom tab bar (5 tabs: Nook, Planner, Piggy Bank, Budget, Pod) with safe area insets, Heritage Orange 8% background pill active state, nested route matching, dark mode support
- **`src/components/common/MobileHamburgerMenu.vue`** — Full-screen slide-in overlay from left with Deep Slate background, brand logo, controls section (member filter, privacy toggle, language selector, currency chips), all 9 nav items, user profile card, security indicators footer. Closes on backdrop click, Escape key, and route change
- **`src/components/common/AppHeader.vue`** — Mobile: hamburger button + greeting/page title + notification bell. Desktop: unchanged (all controls preserved)
- **`src/App.vue`** — Sidebar hidden on mobile (`v-if="isDesktop"`), bottom nav shown on mobile, hamburger menu wired up, reduced mobile padding (`p-4 md:p-6`), bottom padding clearance (`pb-24`)
- **`src/components/ui/BaseModal.vue`** — `fullscreenMobile` prop: removes rounded corners and max-width on mobile viewports
- **`src/constants/navigation.ts`** — `MobileTabDef` interface and `MOBILE_TAB_ITEMS` constant (5 tabs: Nook, Planner, Piggy Bank, Budget, Pod)
- **`src/services/translation/uiStrings.ts`** — 7 new i18n keys: `mobile.nook`, `mobile.pod`, `mobile.menu`, `mobile.closeMenu`, `mobile.navigation`, `mobile.controls`, `mobile.viewingAll`
- **Responsive page pass** — Fixed hardcoded grid/width classes across 5 pages:
  - TransactionsPage: `grid-cols-2` → `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` (2 form modals)
  - GoalsPage: `grid-cols-2` → `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` (2 form modals)
  - AssetsPage: `grid-cols-2` → `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` (card value display)
  - ReportsPage: `w-64`/`w-48`/`w-40` → `w-full md:w-*` (4 fixed-width selects)
  - FamilyPage: `grid-cols-2`/`grid-cols-3` → responsive variants (4 form grids)

### PWA Functionality (Issue #6) — Closed

- **`index.html`** — Added PWA meta tags: `theme-color` (with dark mode media variant), `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style`, `apple-mobile-web-app-title`, `description`
- **`vite.config.ts`** — Completed manifest (`start_url`, `scope`, `orientation`, `categories`); changed `registerType` from `autoUpdate` to `prompt` for user-controlled SW updates
- **`src/composables/useOnline.ts`** — Singleton reactive `isOnline` ref with `online`/`offline` event listeners
- **`src/composables/usePWA.ts`** — `canInstall`, `isInstalled`, `installApp()`, `dismissInstallPrompt()` with 7-day localStorage dismissal persistence; `beforeinstallprompt` handling, standalone mode detection
- **`src/components/common/OfflineBanner.vue`** — Heritage Orange slide-down banner when offline ("You're offline — changes are saved locally"), `aria-live="polite"`
- **`src/components/common/InstallPrompt.vue`** — Dismissible install card shown 30s after page load with brand icon, install/dismiss buttons, bottom-positioned on mobile, bottom-right on desktop
- **`src/components/common/UpdatePrompt.vue`** — Deep Slate banner using `useRegisterSW` from `virtual:pwa-register/vue` with "Update now" / "Later" buttons, hourly background update checks
- **Settings page** — "Install App" card section visible when installable or already installed (green checkmark)
- **`MobileHamburgerMenu.vue`** — Added loading spinner to mobile language selector (was missing visual feedback during translation)
- 12 new i18n keys with beanie mode overrides (`pwa.*`, `settings.installApp*`)
- 4 new test files (19 tests): useOnline, usePWA, OfflineBanner, MobileBottomNav
- **E2E fix** — TrustDeviceModal dismissed in auth helper to prevent pointer event interception in CI

### Automated Translation Pipeline

- Fixed broken `scripts/updateTranslations.mjs` parser (was matching `UI_STRINGS`, now parses `STRING_DEFS` line-by-line)
- Added `--all` flag for multi-language translation (default behavior), stale key cleanup, CI-friendly summary output
- Populated `public/translations/zh.json` with all 655 translations (was 287)
- Created `.github/workflows/translation-sync.yml` — daily cron at 3 AM UTC with conditional auto-deploy
- Updated `package.json` translate scripts, `scripts/README.md`, ADR-008, new `docs/TRANSLATION.md`
- Added Playwright browser caching to CI workflow (saves ~8 min per E2E run)

### Mobile Privacy Toggle

- Show/hide financial figures icon now always visible in mobile/tablet header (previously buried in hamburger menu)
- Sits next to notification bell with same squircle styling, beanie blink animation, and green status dot

### Count-Up Animation for All Summary Cards

- **`src/composables/useAnimatedCurrency.ts`** — Reusable composable wrapping `useCountUp` + `convertToDisplay` + `formatCurrencyWithCode` + privacy mode masking. Returns `{ formatted, displayValue }`. When privacy mode is on, target drops to 0 so revealing figures triggers a fresh count-up from zero
- **NetWorthHeroCard** — Hero net worth amount (800ms duration) and change amount (200ms delay) now animate on load and when values change
- **AccountsPage** — 3 summary cards (Total Assets, Total Liabilities, Net Worth) with staggered delays (0/100/200ms)
- **TransactionsPage** — 6 summary cards: 3 transaction tab (Period Income, Expenses, Net) + 3 recurring tab (Monthly Income, Expenses, Net) with staggered delays
- **AssetsPage** — 4 summary cards (Total Asset Value, Total Loans, Net Asset Value, Appreciation/Depreciation) with staggered delays (0/100/200/300ms)
- **GoalsPage** — 3 integer count cards (Active, Completed, Overdue goals) using `useCountUp` directly with staggered delays
- All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility setting

### Trusted Device Mode (Issue #74) — Closed

- `isTrustedDevice` and `trustedDevicePromptShown` flags in GlobalSettings (registry DB)
- `signOut()` conditionally preserves IndexedDB cache when trusted device is enabled
- `signOutAndClearData()` action always deletes cache regardless of trust setting
- One-time `TrustDeviceModal` shown after first successful sign-in + data load
- Settings toggle in Security section to enable/disable trusted device
- Hamburger menu shows dual sign-out options when trusted device is on
- 8 new i18n keys for trust prompt, settings toggle, and sign-out options

### Login Page UI Redesign (Issue #69) — Closed

- **5-view login flow** per v6 wireframes replacing the old 4-view monolithic flow:
  - **Welcome Gate (00a)** — Three large branded path cards: "Sign in to your pod", "Create a new pod!" (Heritage Orange gradient), "Join an existing pod"
  - **Load Pod (00b)** — File picker drop zone, disabled cloud connector placeholders (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud), security messaging cards, integrated decrypt modal (BaseModal with password input, auto-decrypt via sessionStorage cached password)
  - **Pick Bean (00b-3)** — Avatar grid with `BeanieAvatar` at 88px, green/orange status indicators, password form for sign-in or create-password for new members, back button returns to avatar grid when member selected
  - **Create Pod (00c)** — 3-step mini-onboarding wizard: Step 1 name/password → Step 2 choose storage (local file via `showSaveFilePicker`) → Step 3 add family members. Navigates directly to `/dashboard`
  - **Join Pod (00d)** — Family code input with dark slate "What happens next?" info card. Shows informative error (server-side registry not yet implemented)
- **`/welcome` dedicated route** — Unauthenticated users always land on Welcome Gate first; auto-load to Load Pod only triggers after clicking "Sign in to your pod"
- **`LoginBackground.vue`** — Warm gradient (`from-[#F8F9FA] via-[#FEF0E8] to-[#EBF5FD]`), wider `max-w-[580px]`
- **`LoginSecurityFooter.vue`** — Compact inline footer with 4 security badges at `opacity-30`
- **`LoginPage.vue`** — 5-view orchestrator with store initialization on mount, auto-load deferred to navigation
- **Legacy setup wizard removed** — `SetupPage.vue` deleted, `/setup` route removed, create pod wizard handles full onboarding
- **Deleted**: `SignInView.vue`, `TrustBadges.vue`, `SetupPage.vue`
- **~50 new i18n keys** in `uiStrings.ts` under `loginV6.*` namespace

### Encryption Pipeline Security Hardening (Issue #84) — Closed

- **Critical security fix**: 7 bugs in the sync pipeline could cause encrypted `.beanpod` files to be silently written in plaintext
- **`syncService.ts`**: Added `setEncryptionRequiredCallback()` — `triggerDebouncedSave()`, `flushPendingSave()`, and `save()` now refuse to write when encryption is required but no password is available (defense-in-depth)
- **`syncStore.ts`**: Removed hardcoded `encryptionEnabled: false` from `loadFromFile()`, `loadFromNewFile()`, and `disconnect()` — encryption setting now persists correctly across file operations
- **`syncStore.ts`**: `requestPermission()` no longer arms auto-sync before password is available; `decryptPendingFile()` sets password and encryption flag before reloading stores, then arms auto-sync
- **`MobileHamburgerMenu.vue`**: Fixed sign-out order — `signOut()` now flushes pending saves before `resetAllStores()` clears the session password (matching AppHeader pattern)
- **`fileSync.ts`**: `exportToFile()` now respects encryption settings; `importSyncFileData()` preserves local `encryptionEnabled` value instead of importing from file

### Family Member Role Display Fix

- `FamilyBeanRow.vue` `getRoleLabel` now checks `member.ageGroup` (adult/child) instead of only `member.role`
- Adults with 'member' role correctly show "Parent"/"Big Bean" instead of "Little Bean"

### Cross-Device Passkey Authentication Fix (Issue #108) — Superseded

- **Implemented but superseded** by the Automerge + Family Key migration (#119)
- Level 1 (cross-device UX) and Level 2 (PRF-wrapped password in .beanpod) were fully implemented
- The family key model eliminates the cross-device problem entirely — passkeys wrap the family key directly, which is always available in the file envelope
- All #108 code (PasskeySecret type, passkeyCrypto wrapPassword/unwrapPassword, cross-device flow in BiometricLoginView/LoginPage, passkeySecrets in sync layer) will be replaced or removed during the migration (#114, #115, #116)

### Biometric Login After Family Switching (Issue #16 follow-up)

- **LoadPodView.vue** — Added biometric detection before password modal: checks `isPlatformAuthenticatorAvailable()` + `hasRegisteredPasskeys()` when encrypted file is loaded, emits `biometric-available` event to switch to BiometricLoginView
- **LoginPage.vue** — Handles `biometric-available` event from LoadPodView, `biometricDeclined` flag prevents loops when user clicks "Use password instead", resets on family switch/navigation
- **authStore.ts** — Fixed `signInWithPasskey()` using stale `familyContextStore.activeFamilyId` instead of the authoritative `familyId` parameter during family switching
- **passwordCache.test.ts** — Added missing `setSessionDEK` and `flushPendingSave` to syncService mock (pre-existing CI failure)

### Cross-Device Sync (Issue #103) — Closed

- **`syncStore.ts` — `reloadIfFileChanged()`**: Lightweight `getFileTimestamp()` check, full reload only when file is newer. Handles encrypted files via session password → session DEK → cached password fallback chain
- **`syncStore.ts` — `startFilePolling()` / `stopFilePolling()`**: 10-second interval polling for external file changes, auto-started by `setupAutoSync()`, stopped on sign-out/disconnect
- **`App.vue` — visibility change handling**: `reloadIfFileChanged()` on tab/app resume; `syncStore.syncNow(true)` force save on `hidden` to prevent data loss on quick reload
- **Data loss fix**: `flushPendingSave()` + `syncNow(true)` on `visibilityState: hidden` ensures debounced saves are flushed before page reload
- Cloud relay for near-instant sync planned as follow-up (#118, supersedes #104)

### Family Nook Landing Page Fix

- All 5 login components (PickBeanView, BiometricLoginView, JoinPodView, CreatePodView, LoadPodView) now redirect to `/nook` instead of `/dashboard` after sign-in
- NotFoundPage "Go Home" button navigates to `/nook`
- E2E tests updated to expect `/nook` after authentication

### Biometric Login Fallback Fix (LoadPodView)

- Fixed bug where "use password instead" after biometric prompt showed old family members instead of decrypt modal
- Root cause: `autoLoadFile()` called `syncStore.loadFromFile()` reading from old configured file handle instead of pending encrypted file
- Fix: check `syncStore.hasPendingEncryptedFile` before re-reading

### Deploy Workflow CI Gating

- Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to poll for CI/security check completion (15s interval, 10min timeout) instead of failing immediately
- Fails immediately if no CI run exists for the latest commit (prevents bypassing CI)

### NookGreeting UI Cleanup

- Removed duplicate notification bell and privacy mask icons from `NookGreeting.vue` (already present in header)

### Codebase Deduplication & Cleanup (PR #107) — Closed

Comprehensive review of 243 source files (~49,700 lines) identified and consolidated ~2,000+ lines of duplicated or redundant code across 6 phases (84 files changed, net reduction of 544 lines):

- **Shared utilities:** Extracted `currency.ts` (currency conversion, 6 consumers), `useMemberInfo.ts` (member lookup, 5 pages), `toDateInputValue()` (date formatting, 4 files)
- **Generic repository factory:** `createRepository.ts` eliminates identical CRUD boilerplate across 8 IndexedDB repositories (~474 lines)
- **Toast notification system:** `useToast.ts` + `ToastContainer.vue` — module-level singleton for user-visible error/success/warning/info notifications. Error toasts are sticky. Replaces silent `console.error` calls
- **Store action helper:** `wrapAsync()` in `useStoreActions.ts` replaces 23 identical try/catch/finally blocks across 8 stores (~484 lines). CRUD failures automatically show sticky error toasts
- **Member filter factory:** `useMemberFiltered.ts` consolidates 20+ filtered getter patterns across 5 stores
- **Component consolidation:** Unified `MemberChipFilter.vue` (replaced 2 near-identical components), `useFormModal.ts` composable (5 modals), `ActionButtons.vue` (4 pages)
- **CSS cleanup:** 172 hardcoded hex colors replaced with Tailwind semantic tokens, `nook-section-label` utility applied to 8 inline duplicates, shared `nook-card-dark` class for 4 nook widgets
- **Dead code removal:** 6 unused date utility functions removed
- 10 new shared modules created. 462/462 unit tests passed, 54/57 E2E tests passed (1 pre-existing flaky)
- Full plan: `docs/plans/2026-03-01-codebase-dedup-cleanup.md`

### Node.js 24 Upgrade

- Upgraded all CI/CD workflows and `.nvmrc` from Node 20 to Node 24
- Eliminated recurring TypeScript strictness mismatches between local dev (Node 24) and CI (Node 20)
- Removed Node version matrix from `main-ci.yml` (was `[20.x, 24.x]`, now single `24`)
- Fixed `createRepository.ts` TS2352 error exposed by Node 24's stricter TypeScript

### Text Casing Standardization

- Standardized all non-sentence UI text to lowercase across `uiStrings.ts` (~150 strings)
- Fixed AppHeader page title system: reads `route.meta.titleKey` → `t(titleKey)` instead of empty `route.meta.title`
- Dashboard and Nook pages show greeting instead of page title in AppHeader
- Removed duplicate `<h1>` page titles from AccountsPage, TransactionsPage, FamilyPlannerPage, FamilyTodoPage
- Updated E2E planner tests to use case-insensitive matchers
- Documented casing standard in `.claude/skills/beanies-theme.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
- Regenerated Chinese translations for all changed strings

### Budget Page (Issue #68) — Closed

- **Data model** — `Budget`, `BudgetCategory`, `BudgetMode` types in `models.ts`. `CreateBudgetInput`/`UpdateBudgetInput` aliases. `'budget'` added to `EntityType` union. `budgets` added to `SyncFileData.data`
- **Database** — DB_VERSION 5→6. `budgets` object store with `by-memberId` and `by-isActive` indexes. Export/import/clear support
- **`src/services/indexeddb/repositories/budgetRepository.ts`** (new) — Standard `createRepository` pattern + `getActiveBudget()` helper
- **`src/stores/budgetStore.ts`** (new) — Core budget state + cross-store computed getters: `activeBudget`, `effectiveBudgetAmount` (resolves percentage mode), `categoryBudgetStatus` (per-category spend tracking with ok/warning/over), `budgetProgress`, `paceStatus` (great/onTrack/caution/overBudget), `upcomingTransactions` (next 5 recurring), `monthlySavings`, `savingsRate`, recurring/one-time breakdowns
- **`src/components/budget/BudgetSettingsModal.vue`** (new) — BeanieFormModal with mode toggle (% of income / fixed), percentage input with live effective budget preview, fixed amount input, currency selector, FamilyChipPicker for owner, collapsible category allocations with per-category AmountInput
- **`src/components/budget/QuickAddTransactionModal.vue`** (new) — Simplified transaction entry: direction toggle (Money In/Out), hero AmountInput, CategoryChipPicker, description, date, account select
- **`src/pages/BudgetPage.vue`** (new) — Full budget tracking page:
  - Hero card: Deep Slate gradient, Heritage Orange progress bar with time-position marker, motivational message + emoji based on pace
  - 3-column summary cards: Monthly Income, Current Spending, Monthly Savings (with recurring/one-time breakdowns, count-up animation)
  - Two-column content: Upcoming Transactions (next 5 scheduled) + Spending by Category (progress bars, color-coded status)
  - Bottom section: Budget Settings card + Add Transactions card (Quick Add functional, Batch Add + CSV Upload with "beanies in development" badge)
  - Empty state with EmptyStateIllustration when no budget exists
  - Privacy mode, dark mode, and mobile responsive support
- **Router + navigation** — `/budgets` route changed from DashboardPage to BudgetPage. `comingSoon` removed from budgets nav item
- **Sync infrastructure** — Budgets added to mergeService, fileSync validation + change detection, syncStore auto-sync watch + reload, App.vue data loading
- **EmptyStateIllustration** — Added `'budget'` variant with beanie + bar chart SVG
- ~70 new translation strings under `budget.*` namespace with beanie mode overrides
- Plan saved: `docs/plans/2026-03-01-budget-page.md`
- **Bug fixes (post-launch):**
  - Fixed zero spending bug: `isDateBetween()` normalized to date-only string comparison to eliminate timezone-dependent filtering failures
  - Fixed member filter not applied to budget summary cards (income, spending, savings, category breakdowns now use filtered variants)
  - Fixed multi-currency category aggregation (raw amounts now converted via `convertToBaseCurrency()` before summing)
  - Fixed emoji unicode escapes rendering as literal text on Add Transactions card
  - Redesigned Budget Settings card to match v7 UI mockup (side-by-side mode cards, Heritage Orange info callout)

### Projected Recurring Transactions (2026-03-03)

- **Projected transactions** — Future recurring transactions now appear as projections in the transactions list for any future month, giving users visibility into upcoming expenses/income
- **Deferred side effects** — Clicking a projected transaction offers scope selection (this only / this and future / all). Side effects (materializing a transaction or splitting a recurring item) are deferred until the user saves, preventing orphaned records on cancel
- **RecurringEditScopeModal** — Shared global modal for scope selection, registered in `App.vue`
- **`useProjectedTransactions` composable** — Generates ephemeral projected `DisplayTransaction` entries from active recurring items for the selected month
- **startDate → dayOfMonth sync** — Changing a recurring item's start date now auto-syncs the `dayOfMonth` field (clamped to 28) so that `syncLinkedTransactions` picks up the new day. Also syncs `monthOfYear` for yearly items
- **dayOfMonth field repositioned** — Moved between start date and end date in the recurring editor for better discoverability
- **Store immutability fixes** — Replaced all 19 in-place array mutations (`.push()`, `array[index]=`) with immutable patterns (spread, `.map()`) across 9 stores (accounts, family, goals, assets, todo, activity, budget, familyContext, tombstone). Prevents Vue 3.4+ computed reference-equality optimization from skipping re-evaluation
- **Today button on MonthNavigator** — Heritage Orange pill button appears next to month arrows when viewing a non-current month; clicking it jumps back to the current month
- 5 new TDD tests for startDate→dayOfMonth sync, all 659 tests passing

### Income-to-Goal Linking

- **Income transactions can be linked to financial goals** with automatic progress tracking — percentage or fixed-amount allocation with guardrail (auto-cap to remaining amount)
- `goalId`, `goalAllocMode`, `goalAllocValue`, `goalAllocApplied` fields added to `Transaction`; `goalId`, `goalAllocMode`, `goalAllocValue` added to `RecurringItem`
- `EntityLinkDropdown.vue` — generic dropdown extracted from `ActivityLinkDropdown.vue` (same mechanism, prop-driven data source); `ActivityLinkDropdown` simplified to thin wrapper
- Goal link section in `TransactionModal` — visible for income transactions only, with goal dropdown (currency-filtered), percentage/fixed toggle, allocation preview with capped indicator
- Store-level goal progress: `applyGoalAllocation()` and `adjustGoalProgress()` in `transactionsStore.ts` — mirrors `adjustAccountBalance` pattern; integrated into create/update/delete flows
- Recurring processor goal allocation — computes and applies allocation at transaction generation time (repo-level, outside Vue reactivity)
- Goals store reload after `processRecurringItems()` in `TransactionsPage.vue` (2 sites) and `App.vue` (4 sites) to fix stale reactive state
- 7 `goalLink.*` translation keys with beanie overrides
- Plan: `docs/plans/2026-03-05-income-to-goal-linking.md`

### CurrencyAmountInput Reusable Component

- **`CurrencyAmountInput.vue`** — extracted inline currency dropdown + `AmountInput` pattern used in 4 modals (Transaction, Account, Goal, Activity) into single reusable component with `v-model:amount` and `v-model:currency` two-way bindings
- Added currency dropdown to `ActivityModal` (was previously locked to base currency with no UI selector); changed default from `baseCurrency` to `displayCurrency`
- Restyled `GoalModal` currency dropdown to match Transaction/Account inline pattern (replaced separate `BaseSelect`)
- Net -64 lines across all modals

### Nook Card Click-to-Edit Modals

- **ScheduleCards** — merged planner activities (from `activityStore.upcomingActivities`) into Today and This Week cards alongside todos; unified `ScheduleItem` type with click-to-edit via emits
- **RecentActivityCard** — added click handlers emitting `open-todo` / `open-transaction` for inline editing
- **FamilyNookPage** — wired `TodoViewEditModal`, `ActivityModal`, and `TransactionModal` with save/delete handlers (edit-only, no create); all card items open modals directly on the Nook page without navigation
- **NookTodoWidget reactivity fix** — changed `selectedTodo: ref<TodoItem | null>` to `selectedTodoId: ref<string | null>` + computed lookup from `todoStore.todos` (same pattern as FamilyTodoPage)

### Recurring Activity/Transaction Scope UX (2026-03-09)

- **Scope modal moved to save time** — "This only / This & all future / All occurrences" modal now appears after the user clicks Save (not before opening the edit modal). Applies to both recurring activities and projected transactions. Users can see what they're changing before deciding scope.
- **Occurrence date banner** — Edit modals for recurring activities and projected transactions show the specific occurrence date being edited (e.g. "Editing occurrence on Mon, Mar 16, 2026").
- **Inline edit scope handling** — `ActivityViewEditModal` uses `scopeResolved` flag so scope is only asked once per editing session. After "this only" materialization, the override has `recurrence: 'none'` so scope check is naturally skipped.
- **`useActivityScopeEdit` composable** — Shared between `FamilyPlannerPage` and `FamilyNookPage` to eliminate duplicated scope logic (DRY).
- **Automerge proxy fix** — `splitActivity` and `materializeOverride` now use `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` to deep-clone proxy objects, fixing `'get' on proxy: Symbol(_am_meta)'` errors.
- **`materializeOverride` spread order fix** — `recurrence: 'none'` is now applied after `...overrides` spread to prevent form data from overwriting it.
- Plan: `docs/plans/2026-03-09-per-instance-activity-overrides.md`

### Google Drive Resilience Fixes (2026-03-09)

- **5xx retry with exponential backoff** — `GoogleDriveProvider` now retries on 503/5xx errors up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s). After exhausting retries on write, queues to offline flush instead of throwing unhandled.
- **Init file polling suppression** — `deferPolling()` / `startDeferredPolling()` prevents `setupAutoSync` from starting file polling until after `processRecurringItems` completes, breaking the init mutation → file poll → reload → more mutations cascade.
- **30-second init timeout** — If `loadFamilyData` takes longer than 30s (due to Drive API issues), the spinner is dismissed so the app is usable. Data continues loading in the background.

### Multi-Owner Activities & Todos (2026-03-11)

- **Multi-assignee support** — Activities and todos now support multiple owners via new `assigneeIds: UUID[]` field alongside legacy `assigneeId` (backward compatible). Activities require 1+ owners, todos allow 0+
- **Normalizer pattern** — `normalizeAssignees()` and `toAssigneePayload()` in `src/utils/assignees.ts` are the single source of truth for all assignee reads/writes. All consumers call the normalizer, never read `assigneeId` directly
- **`MemberChip.vue` extraction** — Reusable presentational component (`sm`/`md` size variants) replacing 5+ duplicated inline member-chip patterns across `DayAgendaSidebar`, `UpcomingActivities`, `TodoPreview`, `TodoItemCard`, `NookTodoWidget`, `ActivityViewEditModal`, `TodoViewEditModal`
- **Multi-select UX** — `FamilyChipPicker` switched to `mode="multi"` for assignees with confirm (✓) / cancel (✕) buttons in inline edit slots. Dropoff/pickup stay single-select with auto-save + cancel button
- **Data layer updates** — `useMemberFiltered` composable widened to accept `string | string[] | undefined | null` (array-aware filtering). `useCriticalItems` shows notifications for all assignees. Activity and todo repositories use `normalizeAssignees().includes()` for queries
- **All consuming components updated** — 23 files modified across stores, composables, repositories, modals, list views, pages, and quick-add flows
- **Tests** — 9 new unit tests for normalizer/payload builder, 4 new `useCriticalItems` multi-assignee tests, 3 new `activityStore` filter tests, 12 E2E planner tests updated to select assignee (required by new `canSave` validation)
- Plan: `docs/plans/2026-03-11-multi-owner-activities-todos.md`

### beanies-plan Skill (2026-03-11)

- **`.claude/skills/beanies-plan/SKILL.md`** — Standardized plan & issue creation skill for consistent plan documents and GitHub issues with full context preservation
- 5-phase workflow: Gather & Clarify → Draft Plan → Iterate Until Approved → Save Plan → Create GitHub Issue (optional)
- Captures all user prompts verbatim (initial + follow-ups + redirections) as a permanent prompt log
- Enforces plan document format, GitHub issue format with 2-way links, and project labeling conventions
- Always asks whether to create a GitHub issue or implement directly

### Recent Improvements (2026-03-11)

- **Activity start+end time display** — All activity time displays (Nook schedule cards, planner sidebar upcoming section) now show both start and end times (e.g. "10:00 - 11:30") instead of just start time
- **Activity view modal readability overhaul** — Cleaner, more compact layout:
  - Pick-up/drop-off duties promoted into grey summary box at top (with inline editing)
  - Date and times consolidated into a single row (3-col for one-off, 2-col for recurring)
  - Empty optional fields (location, cost, instructor, notes) hidden in view mode — use Edit to add
  - "Created by" reduced to subtle inline footer text
  - Edit button moved to modal footer alongside Close (was a full-width row in the body)
  - BeanieFormModal now supports `footer-start` slot for extra footer actions
- **Sign-out modal improvements:**
  - Fixed InfoHintBadge tooltip overflow on mobile (positioned from right edge with viewport max-width)
  - Both sign-out options now side by side with emojis (🚪 Sign Out / 🗑️ Clear & Sign Out) and equal-height buttons
  - Cancel moved to subtle text link below
- **Family member data loss bug fix** — `CreatePodView.handleFinish()` now checks `syncNow()` return value and retries on failure; `OnboardingWizard` skip/finish handlers explicitly save via `syncNow(true)`

### Recent Fixes

- **Join flow cross-browser decrypt fix** — When a new member joined via invite link and created a password, the `joinFamily()` flow only stored a `passwordHash` in the Automerge doc but never created a `wrappedKey` entry in the V4 envelope. This meant password-based file decryption failed on different browsers/devices (e.g. Safari PWA after joining via Chrome on iOS, where storage is completely isolated). Fix: added `wrapFamilyKeyForMember()` to syncStore that derives an AES-KW wrapping key from the password and wraps the family key, called from `JoinPodView.handleCreatePassword()` before syncing.
- **Envelope merge race condition fix** — `fetchAndMergeRemote()` in `doSave()` was doing wholesale `currentEnvelope = remoteEnvelope` replacement, which could overwrite locally-added `inviteKeys`, `wrappedKeys`, and `passkeyWrappedKeys` when a prior auto-save wrote a version without them. Fix: merge local keys into remote envelope before assignment.
- **Family key cache on join fix** — `cacheFamilyKey()` silently returned when device was not trusted, causing data loss after page refresh or PWA install following a successful join. Fix: added `force` option to `cacheFamilyKey()` and force-cache during join/decrypt flows. Also fixed `App.vue` to redirect to `/welcome` when auto-decrypt fails instead of falling through to an empty Automerge doc.
- **Google Picker API for join flow** — When `drive.file` scope can't read a file shared by another user (returns 404), the join flow now shows a Google Picker button to let the invitee select the shared `.beanpod` file from their Drive (grants `drive.file` access). Includes `drivePicker.ts` service, `google-picker.d.ts` type declarations, and picker fallback UI in `JoinPodView.vue`. Plan: `docs/plans/2026-03-05-google-picker-invite-email-sharing.md`.
- **Email sharing in invite modal** — Optional email field in the invite modal (`FamilyPage.vue`) lets the pod owner share the `.beanpod` file with a family member's Google account directly via the Drive Permissions API. Uses `shareFileWithEmail()` in `driveService.ts`.
- **Google OAuth re-consent loop fix** — Three-layer fix preventing PWA users from being forced to re-consent on every page refresh:
  1. `getValidToken()` and 401 fallbacks in `googleDriveProvider.ts` now pass `forceConsent: true` when no refresh token exists (Google only issues refresh tokens with `prompt=consent`)
  2. `App.vue` requests `navigator.storage.persist()` on startup to prevent browser eviction of IndexedDB
  3. Refresh tokens dual-written to IndexedDB + localStorage as defense-in-depth against storage eviction (iOS Safari 7-day policy, PWA storage pressure)
  - New `hasRefreshToken()` export in `googleAuth.ts` for cross-module access
  - Plan: `docs/plans/2026-03-04-fix-oauth-reconsent-loop.md`
- **Multi-family isolation hardening** — Fixed cross-family data leakage when authenticated user's familyId could not be resolved:
  - Added cached session familyId as 4th fallback in auth resolution chain (JWT → getUserAttributes → registry → cached session)
  - Authenticated users no longer fall back to `lastActiveFamilyId` (which could belong to a different user)
  - Placeholder family creation now uses auth-resolved ID instead of random UUID (`createFamilyWithId()`)
  - Sync service refuses to load sync file whose `familyId` doesn't match the active family (in `loadAndImport`, `openAndLoadFile`, `decryptAndImport`)
  - Sync service skips initialization when no active family is set (prevents legacy key fallback)
  - Sync service `reset()` clears stale file handles and session passwords on family switch
  - Sync service tracks `currentFileHandleFamilyId` — `save()` blocks writes if handle belongs to a different family
  - Added `closeDatabase()` before loading family data to ensure clean DB connection
  - 22 multi-family isolation tests (up from 19)
- **BaseModal scroll fix** — Modal body now uses `flex-1 overflow-y-auto` with `max-h-[calc(100vh-2rem)]` so tall content scrolls instead of overflowing below the viewport (discovered via asset loan form E2E tests)
- Restored ReportsPage that was wiped during bulk ESLint/Prettier formatting
- Added data-testid attributes to transaction items and account cards for E2E tests
- Fixed E2E tests to switch to transactions tab before interacting with elements
- Switched from idb library to native IndexedDB APIs

### AWS Infrastructure & Deployment (Issue #7) — Closed

  - `frontend` module: S3 bucket (CloudFront OAC), CloudFront distribution (HTTPS, gzip, SPA routing), ACM cert (DNS-validated), Route53 A/AAAA records
- **CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) — Two-job GitHub Actions workflow:
  - `test` job: lint, type-check, Vitest unit tests, Playwright E2E (chromium), production build
  - `deploy` job: S3 sync + CloudFront cache invalidation (only runs after tests pass)
  - All secrets (AWS credentials, S3 bucket, CloudFront ID) stored in GitHub Secrets
- **Live at** `https://beanies.family` (and `https://www.beanies.family`)
- All sub-issues closed: #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14

## In Progress

- **Multi-Family with File-Based Auth** — Per-family databases, file-based authentication (Cognito removed), passkey/biometric login implemented

### Completed Goals Section (Issue #55)

- Collapsible "Completed Goals" disclosure section below active goals list (collapsed by default)
- Completed goals sorted by most recently completed, showing name, type, member, completion date, and final amounts
- Reopen button moves a goal back to the active list; delete button removes with whoosh sound
- Muted styling distinguishes completed from active goals; privacy mode blur on amounts
- Renamed "All Goals" card to "Active Goals" for clarity
- 3 new translation keys with beanie mode overrides (`goals.reopenGoal`, `goals.noCompletedGoals`, `goals.completedOn`)

### Financial Institution Dropdown (Issue #42) — Closed

- **`BaseCombobox.vue`** — Reusable searchable single-select dropdown with "Other" support, custom text input, clear button, backward compatibility for free-text values
- **`src/constants/institutions.ts`** — 22 predefined global banks (BoA, HSBC, DBS, JPMorgan Chase, etc.) with name/shortName
- **`src/constants/countries.ts`** — 249 ISO 3166-1 countries for optional country selector
- **`useInstitutionOptions`** composable merges predefined + user-saved custom institutions into sorted dropdown options
- Replaced plain text institution input on AccountsPage (add + edit modals) with institution combobox + country combobox
- Replaced plain text lender input on AssetsPage loan section (add + edit modals) with institution combobox + country combobox
- Custom institutions only persisted when form is saved (not on typing); deletable from dropdown with X button
- Deleting a custom institution clears it from all linked accounts and asset loans
- `institutionCountry` added to Account, `lenderCountry` added to AssetLoan, `customInstitutions` added to Settings
- 7 new translation keys with beanie mode overrides
- **E2E tests** (8 tests): predefined selection, search/filter, custom "Other" entry, country selection, edit pre-population, shared custom institutions across accounts and assets
- **`ComboboxHelper`** E2E helper class and **`AssetsPage`** page object created
- **BaseModal scroll fix**: tall modal content (e.g. asset loan form) now scrolls instead of overflowing below viewport

### Beanie Language Mode (Issue #35) — Closed

- Optional beanie mode toggle in Settings replacing standard UI strings with friendly bean-themed alternatives
- Single source of truth `STRING_DEFS` in `uiStrings.ts` with side-by-side `en` + `beanie` fields
- `t()` resolution: beanie override applied only when `language === 'en'` and `beanieMode === true`
- Translation pipeline always sources from plain English `UI_STRINGS` (hard requirement)
- Toggle disabled and greyed out when non-English language is active
- ~100+ beanie string overrides across all pages
- Unit tests and E2E tests (4 specs)

### Automerge + Family Key Migration (Epic #119)

Major data layer migration from IndexedDB + file-based sync to Automerge CRDT + family key encryption. Plan: `docs/plans/2026-03-02-automerge-family-key-migration.md`

**Phase 1 — Foundation (parallelizable):**

- [x] #110 — Automerge CRDT document service and repository factory
- [x] #111 — Family key encryption, wrapping, and invite link service (PR #121)
- [x] #112 — Google Drive OAuth PKCE migration (replaces GIS implicit grant) — PR #122, deployed to prod

**Phase 2 — Core Migration:**

- [x] #113 — Data layer switchover: IndexedDB → Automerge, sync rewrite, old code removal. Merged to `feature/automerge-migration`. Includes: all 10 stores switched to Automerge repos, sync/persistence layer rewritten for V4 beanpod, 15 deprecated files deleted, regression fixes (Automerge proxy cloning, auth session persistence, passkey lifecycle, exchange rate save). 615 tests passing.

**Phase 3 — Auth & UI:**

- [x] #114 — Auth and onboarding flows for family key model (includes #108 code cleanup). Merged to `feature/automerge-migration`. Includes: family key generation/wrapping, single-password sign-in (no separate file decrypt), passkey PRF-based key unwrapping, magic link invites with crypto tokens, trusted device file caching (passwordless shortcut removed), auto-sign-in after decrypt, inline sign-in form UX. 622 tests passing.
- [x] #115 — UI updates for family key model and invite flow. Merged to `feature/automerge-migration`. Includes: encryption toggle removed from Settings, family key status section, InviteMemberModal (magic link + QR), InviteLinkCard component, JoinPodView invite redemption, CreatePodView/LoadPodView/BiometricLoginView/PasskeySettings updated, useClipboard composable, JSON export. 622 tests passing.

**Phase 4 — Cleanup:**

- [x] #116 — Dead code removal, documentation updates, final verification. Completed on `feature/automerge-migration`. Includes: removed 6 orphaned V3 types from models.ts, deleted legacy migration module (legacyMigration.ts + related imports), removed V3 encryption wrappers, cleaned up stale comments, fixed broken E2E import, rewrote ARCHITECTURE.md for Automerge architecture, updated CLAUDE.md and SECURITY_GUIDE.md, added supersession notes to 6 existing ADRs, created ADRs 018/019/020

**Follow-up:**

- [ ] #117 — Family key rotation on member removal
- [ ] #118 — WebSocket push relay for real-time cross-device sync (supersedes #104)

**Superseded issues (closed):**

- #104 — Cloud relay → superseded by #118
- #108 — Cross-device passkey auth → superseded by family key model (#114)
- #17 — Password rotation → obsoleted by family key model
- #15 — Password recovery → superseded by invite links (#111/#114)

## v6 UI Framework Proposal

A v6 UI framework proposal has been uploaded to `docs/brand/beanies-ui-framework-proposal-v6.html`, superseding v5 with detailed login flow screens for the new file-based authentication model. The v3 proposal was previously removed as obsolete.

v6 introduces a **six-screen authentication flow** built around the Pod concept (encrypted `.beanpod` data files):

- **00a: Welcome Gate** — Three paths: sign in, create pod, join pod
- **00b: Load Your Pod** — File picker + drag-drop zone + cloud storage connectors (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud)
- **00b-2: Unlock Your Pod** — Decrypt loaded file with pod password
- **00b-3: Pick Your Bean** — Family member selection with 88px avatars and onboarding status indicators
- **00c: Create a New Pod** — 3-step wizard (name/password → storage → invite)
- **00d: Join an Existing Pod** — Family code or magic link entry

Additionally, v6 includes all previous v4/v5 screens: Dashboard, Accounts (card + list), Budgets, Transactions, Onboarding, Family Hub, Mobile (4 phone mockups), Landing Page, and Settings.

| Issue | Screen                                                               | Status     |

| #70   | Accounts page redesign — Assets/Liabilities hero + Cards/List toggle | Redesign   |
| #71   | Transactions page — full ledger view                                 | Redesign   |
| #72   | Landing page — public-facing hero page                               | New screen |

## v7 UI Framework Proposal

A v7 UI framework proposal has been uploaded to `docs/brand/beanies-ui-framework-proposal-v7.html`, introducing a major structural reorganisation: the app shifts from finance-first to **family-first**, with three new pages and a collapsible accordion sidebar.

### Key Changes in v7

1. **Sidebar accordion restructure** — Flat nav replaced with two collapsible sections:
   - **The Piggy Bank 🐷** (finance): Overview, Accounts, Budgets, Transactions
   - **The Treehouse 🌳** (family): Family Nook, Family Planner, Family To-Do, Family Hub
   - Settings pinned at bottom, outside both accordions

2. **Family Nook 🏡** — New home screen after login (replaces finance dashboard as entry point). Shows today's schedule, events, milestones, activity feed, shared to-do widget, and Piggy Bank quick-access card

3. **Family Planner 📅** — Calendar and scheduling hub absorbing the old Family Hub calendar. Month/week/day/agenda views, event categorisation, family member filtering

4. **Family To-Do ✅** — Standalone task management page at `/todo`. Quick-add, assignees, date integration with calendar. Purple (#9B59B6) accent colour for to-do elements

5. **Updated mobile bottom tab bar** — 5 tabs: 🏡 Nook, 📅 Planner, 🐷 Piggy Bank, 📋 Budget, 👨‍👩‍👦 Pod

6. **Family Hub updated** — Calendar removed (→ Family Planner), now focused on personal member activity and milestones

7. **Budget page enhancements** — 3 transaction entry methods (Quick Add, Batch Add, CSV Upload), time-position marker, motivational emoji messages, category spending bars

8. **Transactions ledger** — Recurring/one-time type pills, summary pills, enhanced add modal with recurring toggle

## Known Issues

- **Single-family re-login shows LoadPodView instead of auto-decrypting:** When a single family exists and the user clicks "Sign In" after sign-out, `tryAutoDecrypt` fails because `cacheFamilyKey()` only stores the key on trusted devices (`isTrustedDevice === true`). On non-trusted devices, the cached family key is empty, so auto-decrypt falls through to the LoadPodView password form. Needs investigation: either always cache the family key after explicit password entry, or prompt for trusted device earlier in the flow.
- ~~**Data loss after tab idle/sleep — saves fail silently:** After waking from sleep and visiting Settings to check last-saved timestamp, all subsequent saves failed with "no family key or envelope". Data created after visiting Settings was lost on refresh.~~ **Fixed 2026-03-10** — Root cause: `SettingsPage.vue` called `syncStore.initialize()` on mount, which called `syncService.reset()` clearing the encryption key from the sync service (but not the Vue ref). Four-layer fix: (1) removed redundant init from SettingsPage, (2) `syncService.initialize()` skips destructive re-init when already active for same family, (3) `loadFromFile()` now calls `setFamilyKey()` instead of `setEnvelope()` to restore key on every file poll, (4) save-on-hide/unload handlers recover the key from the store ref before saving.
- ~~**Google Drive new account registration fails:** Two errors: (1) "authorization scope was not enough" — granular consent lets users deselect scopes, (2) "File not found" — global folder cache reuses a previous account's folder ID.~~ **Fixed 2026-03-04** — clear folder cache + force consent in `createNew()`, validate `drive.file` scope after token exchange, clear cache on auth failure.

| 2026-03-08 | Join/load flow loading spinners                             | Added BeanieSpinner to all async gaps: file picker, invite token decryption, password creation step. Replaced CSS border spinners with branded BeanieSpinner. Buttons use `:loading` prop for spinner display.
