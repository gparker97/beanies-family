/**
 * OAuth return paths for the login/load flow.
 *
 * These are the `returnPath`s handed to `startRedirectAuth` (via
 * `syncStore.beginDriveAuthRedirect`) so that, after the user consents and the
 * deep link (native) / callback (web) lands back in the app, `LoginPage`'s
 * resume dispatcher knows what to resume.
 *
 * `RESUME_SETUP_PATH` (the create / resume-setup return) lives in
 * `connectStorage.ts` because that module owns connect-new-storage concerns.
 * The *load-existing-pod* return path is a login-flow concern, so it lives here
 * — next to `LoadPodView`, the view that owns the picker.
 *
 * Shared by `LoadPodView` (passes `LOAD_DRIVE_PATH` into the redirect) and
 * `LoginPage` (matches `RESUME_LOAD_DRIVE` to re-open the picker on return).
